We implemented an innovative learning analytics solution, designed to root out agent\ntraining problems at the source.\nAfter running a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative. Download our Cracking the Code: A Learning Analytics Case Study to learn more.\nDATA SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE!\nSpeed-to-proficiency\u2014the time it takes for agents to attain the skills needed to successfully serve their customers\u2014is a driving Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for companies looking to streamline operations. One such company\u2014a worldwide\ntelecom provider\u2014was seeking ways to enhance agent training protocols and improve speed-to-proficiency in one of their most complex billing lines of business.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nTo implement an innovative learning analytics solution\u2014designed to root out agent training problems at the source\nRun a pilot program, the results our agents achieved were nothing short of transformative\nTHE OUTCOME\nEradication of agent struggles\u2014impacting new-hire trainee proficiency\n5% reduction in agent attrition in the first 90 days\n6-day reduction of new-hire training time\n80% knowledge retention after 1 year\nTHE CHALLENGE\nAn Empowered Agent Starts with Better Training. Traditionally, the client\u2019s agent training program was lengthy and costly\u2014not to mention that agents weren\u2019t consistently retaining all of the needed\ninformation to resolve customer billing inquiries. Enter Alorica. Our Training and Quality teams took a look at the situation and asked\u2014how can we shorten the training process, while still helping agents retain knowledge? Faster and better\u2014it\u2019s\nnot an easy code to crack! But then again, they don\u2019t call us for the easy ones.\nTHE SOLUTION\nA New Platform for Challenging the Status Quo. Our teams uncovered opportunities for improving agent knowledge retention and decreasing \u2018confidently-held misinformation\u2019 by using an industry-leading learning analytics technology\nplatform. The platform revealed that through a multi-week training and nesting period, confidently-held misinformation could be reduced through more streamlined training modules. In turn, this resulted in enhanced knowledge retention, and thus the\nability to better navigate customer billing queries.\nIn short, we were able to identify a problem the client didn\u2019t even know they had\u2014and then offer a solution that would totally change the game.\nTHE OUTCOME\nWe\u2019re just Getting Started. Our pilot program was so successful, the client is looking into adopting it for other areas of their business. Furthermore, we received resoundingly positive feedback from agents, who appreciated a novel, innovative\nand interesting approach to their training.\nOverall, the client achieved faster speed-toproficiency, observed a decrease in risk and loss, and realized enhanced agent engagement and satisfaction\u2014all of which led to happier agents, happier customers and a happier client.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

To differentiate from competitors and provide exceptional customer service,\nbusinesses need to transform the customer experience\u2014but doing so requires data-driven insight into which processes are working and which are not.\u00a0 \u00a0 Customer experience analytics can provide these types of insights and drive positive transformation. The challenge, however, is not just in collecting the right type of data but knowing how to pull insight from it. What data points are important? Which\nare not?\nDetermining the Type of Data You Need and Where to Find It\nContact centers, where agents interact directly with customers, provide a gold mine of customer intelligence. Each interaction is an opportunity to learn more about consumers in order to improve the customer experience. Typically, there are three types\nof data you should collect:\nVolume Data \u2013 Contact events are signs that something isn\u2019t easy for customers to solve on their own. Knowing why customers contact you, by what channels, and with what frequency is key to understanding what the customer\nwants and where the stumbling blocks are. Look at average handle times, rates of repeat contacts, escalations and transfers to determine where there are breakdowns in the contact experience \u2013 these are the elements that may be negatively\nimpacting your customers and your business.Behavioral and Emotional Data \u2013 This type of data measures how your agents handle each customer and how customers respond to the interaction. The data collected should include attributes such as communication and interaction\nskills, compliance, and product and procedural knowledge.Outcome Data \u2013 It\u2019s important to be able to predict and replicate success. Outcome data tells you how frequently you are successful in meeting your business objectives once the interaction is over. For example, completing\na sale, avoiding a cancel or gaining a high customer satisfaction rating are all positive outcomes you want to replicate.\nIt is also critical that your data captures interactions that occur across all channels, so you can connect the pieces of the journey and understand which events trigger or prevent others.\nFinding Insights within the Data\nNow that you have collected a substantial amount of customer experience data, let\u2019s discuss how to use analytics to find insights and improve the customer experience. Check out the below categories to consider when you\u2019re looking to shake\nup the status quo.\nAnomalies \u2013 Look at places where the result deviates from the norm. These statistical anomalies can identify areas of potential breakage in the customer experience.Confluence \u2013 Identify where trends, such as economic and social (e.g., consumer spending habits and mobility trends), intersect with each other. The confluence of these trends can reveal new insights or opportunities.Frustrations \u2013 Processes that result in poor outcomes, higher escalation rates or frequent complaints from frontline employees can pinpoint areas where resolution may be cumbersome or ineffective.Orthodoxies \u2013 Question any beliefs or assumptions that are not supported by correlative data. \u201cHow it has always been done\u201d is not always the most effective way, nor is it the most forward-thinking approach.Extremities \u2013 Look at your outliers. Observing contacts with strongly positive outcome data compared with those in similar situations with strongly negative outcome data can help you determine what differentiates a poor outcome\nfrom a positive one.Voyages \u2013 Allow the data to build a history or timeline that you can replicate and immerse yourself in. From here, you\u2019ll be able to glean contextual insights that help you understand which sequences of events culminate\nin positive or negative outcomes.Analogies \u2013 What you borrow or learn from the patterns and benchmarks of your competitors and other companies can enlighten your own business processes.The discoveries you make from your customer experience analytics can inform how you coach and develop your employees, how you program your interactive voice response, what tools you use and how you evaluate and reward your employees and customers.\nApplying Insights to Drive CX Transformation\nTo effectively apply the insights gleaned from the data to create transformation, you must make it digestible and actionable for those who have the ability to make change or alter course based on the findings. This effort requires collaboration and coordination\nacross departments. It should make the translation from \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d to \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d, so the cross-functional team can determine what to do about it.\nWhen presented in these terms, the insights allow customer experience executives to not only clearly define what is going wrong (or right), but also to quantify the costs of problems\u2014and any required solutions. In this way, business decisions become\neasier to make and to justify, and thereby speed up the transformation process and allow your business to remain competitive.\nFor more information on how to use customer experience data to drive transformation,\u00a0download the eBook now.SOURCES\n1 \u00a0https://alorica.com/insight/thats-what-she-said/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc225", "title": "Don't Diss Disruptive Tech", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/dont-diss-disruptive-tech\nDon't Diss Disruptive Tech\nShare this\nDon't diss disruptive tech - because it's here to stay, and it's awesome!\nDownload our overview to learn more about how we're finding sensational new ways to keep making lives better\u2026one interaction at a time with new and insanely great technologies. At Alorica, we\u2019re all about using disruptive using technologies\nin our day-to-day operations. Read on to learn more about some (but not all!) of the tools we\u2019re using to change the game\u2014and the results we\u2019ve seen so far. \u00a0MICROLEARNING  80% of our new hires are millennials\u2014and given their average 90-second attention span, we\u2019ve needed to develop training that is easily digestible and visually engaging. We call this new approach microlearning\u2014short, interactive, 2-10\nminute videos that deliver information \u201cjust in time\u201d\u2014right before the lessons are applied. Typically more effective than traditional \u201cjust in case\u201d classroom learning, Microlearning videos are quick, to-the-point, and\nhelp reduce the need for agents to sit in long, 8-hour PowerPoint classroom training sessions.\nIn action: Microlearning reduced training time by as much as 80% for agents serving a major retail pharmacy provider (and retained up to 20% more information than traditional comparative training classes)\u2014leading to significant\ncost savings for the client.\nGAMIFICATION\nTurning non-game experiences (like providing customer care) into fun, competitive events that motivate, encourage and reinforce learning\u2014 that\u2019s gamification. Through it, employees can interact with a game-like platform to evaluate their performance,\nsee how they stack up against other agents, and earn points that are redeemable for rewards.\nWe customize our systems to each client\u2019s individual objective, and drive agent effort from \u201cacceptable\u201d to \u201coptimal\u201d performanc with game played and reward earned.\nIn action: Businesses who use gamification platforms tend to see positive results with agent performance, attrition, absenteeism and overall satisfaction. It\u2019s simple\u2014engaged employees, who receive a boost in recognition and\nincentives, perform better.\nROBOTIC DESKTOP AUTOMATION (RDA)/ ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)\nMovies may depict robots as the future enslavers of humanity, but they\u2019re actually pretty darn useful when trying to solve issues faster, reduce performance variability and make the interaction between agent and customer a little more pleasant.\nThere are two types of robotic automation; RDA consolidates content from different desktop screens into one singular view, allowing agents to more easily respond to customer requests in realtime. RPA is all about workflow computerization, and\nthese robots identify manual, repetitive and rules-based processes\u2014tackling them in a fraction of the time that it would take an agent, and with complete accuracy.\nIn action: For a major energy company, robotic automation reduced average handle time (AHT) by 10%, and error rates improved to near perfect. For a major telecommunications firm, robots saved the company over $18M per year by allowing\nhundreds of agents to focus on more complex tasks \u00a0DON\u2019T DISS DISRUPTIVE TECH BECAUSE IT\u2019S HERE TO STAY \u2014AND IT\u2019S AWESOME!CHATBOTS\nJob-seekers are active on social media and other non-traditional channels, and we\u2019re implementing chatbot technology as a smarter, faster way to connect with qualified candidates. Thanks to their automated nature, chatbots can handle simultaneous\ncandidate inquiries, provide real-time responses and conduct initial applicant screenings. And because they operate 24/7, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in the number of quality candidates we assess and ultimately hire.In-action: In three months\u2019 time, we were able to interview approximately 3,000 candidates, compared to 966 during the same time-frame without chatbots\u2014saving over 1,200 recruiting man-hours and reducing the cost-per-hire\nby 84%.SPEECH ANALYTICS\nThis new tool is leading to all kinds of \u2018a-ha!\u2019 moments. Through Speech Analytics, we can determine what we are primarily talking to customers about and glean targeted information. Are customers calling about billing? Technology? Something\nelse? How did the call go? Was it a good customer experience? What could we be doing better?\nIn-action: Speech Analytics radically enhances our Quality Assurance model through technology. It allows us to better support our clients and offer new and better capabilities, identify call trends and themes, and help us create even\nmore insanely great customer experiences.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc227", "title": "Lessons in Loyalty", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/lessons-in-loyalty\nLessons in Loyalty\nShare this\nWhile conducting research for this blog, it was surprising to find that the majority of what has been written about loyalty programs revolves around how they can be most effectively implemented to drive sales and retention. This makes sense from the perspective\nthat loyalty programs are, at their core, focused on driving revenue, but the lack of attention to how these programs can impact the customer experience is astonishing.\nA recent study on retail brands found that 79% of respondents left a brand due to a poor customer experience.1\u00a0That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep sight of the potential negative impact that a loyalty program may have on the\ncustomer experience. Establishing a program to drive retention and sales that may actually be driving customers away defeats the purpose of having a loyalty program in the first place! A good starting point when considering the customer experience\nis the effort required of the customer to interact with a brand. For loyalty programs, this takes the form of earning and utilizing the benefits.\nConsider the following three recommendations to establish and monitor an easy-to-use (and easy-to-understand) loyalty program that not only drives sales and retention but also protects the customer experience:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keep it simple and clear\nAccording to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer effort is an important part of building loyalty,2\u00a0and Alorica recently expanded on this in our essential to create a rewards program that is easy to understand and use. To do\nthis, keep these points in mind:\nSimple points system\nThe most common loyalty program methodology is a system where frequent members earn points that translate into some type of reward, and members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. The key here is to ensure that the relationship\nbetween points and tangible rewards is not complex and confusing.\nOne way to maintain clarity is to have a system in which every dollar spent equals a set amount of points, the easiest being a 1:1 ratio. However, this system typically works best for businesses that encourage frequent short-term purchases.3\nSet a clear goal, and make it easy to see progress\nTo prevent customer confusion around a loyalty program, customers must look forward to a clear-cut goal with a finish line (or multiple finish lines) to cross or else they\u2019ll lose interest.4\nA major US hotel chain recently experienced high contact volume of customers who were unsure of their rewards point balance, and wanted to understand the current balance and progress toward their goal. Providing customers with clear and easily accessible\nmethods to discover this information is paramount to reducing customer effort.\nA recent JD & Associates study found that IHG Rewards and Fairmont President\u2019s Club were at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of customer satisfaction with their respective rewards programs.5\u00a0Looking at their mobile apps\nand how points progress is displayed on each may help explain why Hilton is a leader while Fairmont lags behind.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monitor and control\nAn excellent indicator that your loyalty program requires too much effort is when customers are not using it! A program to continuously monitor engagement on your loyalty program not only facilitates retention but can also help ascertain whether your\ncustomers feel that the program is too obtuse.\nRedemption rate (total points redeemed on rewards/total points issued to customers) is one way to measure customer engagement; industry-leading loyalty programs boast a redemption rate of 20%, and the average program sees 14% of points turned into a reward.6\u00a0If\na redemption rate falls below 14%, it may be time to review customer feedback to determine opportunities for improvement.\nGathering customer feedback on your loyalty program is the second component of monitoring and controlling your loyalty program. Instead of waiting until there is a problem to seek feedback from program members, gather info continuously to ensure that\nthe organization has a finger on the pulse of the customer. This data be used when redemption rate dips and also allows an organization to be proactive in reducing effort.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use data for continuous improvement\nLoyalty programs generate countless data points on consumer habits, such as average transaction amount, most frequently purchased items, and much more.7\u00a0This data, combined with customer contact history, provides organizations with the\nammunition needed to proactively prevent future contacts on purchases. If a customer purchased a product and experienced an issue, chances are that they may experience a similar issue with a similar product. Smart businesses will use this data in\nconcert to push proactive content to customers to reduce the likelihood of a future contact.\nPretty simple, right? Create a program that is easy to understand and use, measure its effectiveness, and use the data available to continuously improve your customers\u2019 experience. Seem daunting? If so, we\u2019re here to help!\nAt Alorica, we are insanely passionate about creating effortless customer experiences, and we would be happy to partner with you to unearth opportunities that drive customer retention while maintaining an amazing customer experience.

Discover How Alorica is Unlocking This Opportunity\u2026", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/does-generative-ai-hold-the-key-to-modern-cx-discover-how-alorica-is-unlocking-this-opportunity\nDoes Generative AI Hold the Key to Modern CX? Discover How Alorica is Unlocking This Opportunity\u2026\nAuthored By: Harry Folloder, Alorica\u2019s Chief Digital Officer\nShare this\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing the adoption of artificial intelligence by making it more accessible to a wider audience, with products like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard leading the charge. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT set a new record for the fastest-growing consumer application in history when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch. As a global provider of customer experience (CX) solutions, Alorica is already harnessing the power of generative AI to create more personalized brand interactions.In today\u2019s competitive business environment, every interaction is crucial for brands to meet their customers\u2019 needs. To deliver a positive customer experience, it's essential to understand intent, context, and sentiment to provide a proactive and helpful response that is customized and delivered quickly. As a Large Learning Model (LLM), generative AI is often used to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the unique ability to be trained on large datasets. By seamlessly integrating the intricacies of human language with comprehension of massive content repositories, the promise that lies ahead is more meaningful and relevant responses that underpin chatbots, virtual assistants and other AI-driven language applications in a powerful way.As an LLM, generative AI is a game-changing resource for contact centers delivering CX. Its conversation-generating attribute makes it an incredibly versatile tool that can power self-service bots, automate email responders, and produce report summarizations. While automated chat responses already help brands handle basic queries and perform simple tasks, generative AI adds value in other areas, including in-depth analysis of customer interactions. Service organizations can use it to streamline customer service interactions quickly, easily, and accurately, saving significant time and resources. It also enables brands to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and pain points, using this information to adapt their products, services, and processes.One of the overlooked benefits of generative AI is that it allows enterprises to leverage more unstructured data, such as conversations, chat interactions, and even operating manuals, which is a significant leap forward. This means that previously \"dark data\" can now be resurrected in a meaningful way, providing organizations with valuable intel that they were unable to access before.Alorica has taken the lead in developing and assessing the potential of generative AI to enhance customer satisfaction and lifetime value.For example, Alorica is collaborating with Microsoft and OpenAI on several proof of concepts. Through this partnership, Alorica is using ChatGPT to analyze millions of customer surveys on behalf of a major telecommunications client. The purpose of this initiative is to identify patterns and trends that will enable Alorica and its client to derive actionable insights with exponentially more speed, agility, scalability, consistency, and efficiency.By combining ChatGPT\u2019s analytics and knowledge management capabilities with Alorica\u2019s digital-first approach to servicing over 2 billion customer interactions annually, the goal is to establish use cases and applications that will transform CX. Its first task is to analyze 50,000 data assets from five years and produce a cohesive report in record time. ChatGPT is scanning and analyzing every document and synthesizing all the data within a short period so that companies can take specific actions accordingly. This project will uncover every \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d more rapidly, precisely, and comprehensively.Generative AI is not just a flashy new toy. It represents a breakthrough in natural language processing technology that promises to significantly change how businesses access information and evolve. The dawn of a new era in CX technology and engagement is upon us, and as an industry, we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface. For this reason (and more), Alorica is eager to be at the forefront, harnessing the power of generative AI in its early stages and deploying the tool to help define the next generation of customer experience.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc235", "title": "How to Automate Your Contact Center Without Leaving Your Employees Behind", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/how-to-automate-your-contact-center-without-leaving-your-employees-behind\nHow to Automate Your Contact Center Without Leaving Your Employees Behind\nShare this\nThere\u2019s no arguing that automation of low-skill tasks in contact centers is a trend that is gaining momentum and a strategy that\u2019s important to explore. But, it\u2019s also important to remember that your agents need to be on board with this strategy too. In a market defined by record low unemployment and high competition for talent, retaining key agents can be a competitive advantage. Don\u2019t let your move to automation drive up attrition and take away that advantage.\nInstead, adopt a lesson from industry leaders experienced in deploying self-service strategies and earn the support of your staff before you conceptualize\u00a0what\u00a0you will be automating. That\u2019s done by tuning into the\u00a0why\u00a0and\u00a0how\u00a0of the automation journey.\n1. Make employees part of the why.Employee engagement is paramount to any business transformation effort. Transparency is key. The real magic is in translating your why into something your front line can grab onto and promote alongside you.\nOne of the primary reason\u2019s employees leave a company is because they don\u2019t feel valued or challenged.1\u00a0A strong foundation is built when employees not only feel valued for their skills, but also for their ability to communicate well, focus on the real issues requiring complex problem solving, and maintain a high degree of emotional intelligence along the way. Anyone can reset a password or check an order status. It takes true moxie to resolve an in-depth challenge facing a customer and transform their experience into a game changer. Employees should understand that a move to automation is not meant to replace them. Instead, it\u2019s meant to create more opportunities for them to focus on more complex issues and use their communication and problem-solving skills to the fullest.\n2. Answer \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201dEmployees want to know what\u2019s in it for them, especially as fears arise about what automation means for future job security. Make them part of the process by adopting a hands-on approach. Closed-loop employee input is a great way to involve employees and gain excitement early in the self-service adoption process.\nMake ongoing conversations with employees a priority to learn what challenges recur daily and what prevents true resolution.2\u00a0Ask what could be automated to improve the customer experience and improve focus on the more complex issues. Often times, the largest systemic flaws are identified in these meetings. You\u2019ll walk away with a gold mine of information and employees will feel valued, trusted and, most importantly, heard.\nFact check the feedback against repeat calls, resolution rates, NPS\u00ae scores and CSAT scores to demonstrate the ROI for the investments needed to correct the issue. Then go forth to develop your action plan. Don\u2019t forget to close the loop \u2013 use your regular meetings to share your action plan and progress, ensuring it is understandable to those it will impact the most.\n3. Create a passion for self-service.Keep employees excited about a self-service culture by cultivating a campaign and infrastructure with them in mind.

The cost of attracting new customers continues to increase, making it harder\nto grow business profitably without a steady base of loyal customers. It\u2019s widely understood that it is more expensive to attract a new customer than it is to retain an existing one\u20145x more!\u2014depending on the\u00a0source1\u00a0and\nindustry.\u00a0This principle of customer loyalty is referred to as the Net Promoter Score\u00ae movement.\nSo, we know that giving customers incentives to stay is the key to retention. But how do you do that in such a competitive environment?\nLet\u2019s break it down, shall we?\nListen to your customers\u2019 needs\nTake the time to know your customers\u2014really\u00a0know them. Who are they? What do they really want? Ask simple and pointed questions to get to the root of understanding their desires, what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and how they feel\nabout their current service delivery. This can be accomplished through email surveys, phone marketing, exit interviews or by proactively monitoring social media and online customer forums.\nAct on the data you gather\nChange when change is called for and adapt your business to accommodate the customers you serve. Tailor your support structure and offerings based on their feedback. Let your customers know you heard them. Provide alternative solutions where known issues\nexist. Proactively offer something (a discount, promo item, etc.) to acknowledge those who take the time to provide feedback. Furthermore, it\u2019s important to offer an array of methods to receive feedback\u2014options should include human interaction\n(phone or chat) and self-help (IVR, web or social). It\u2019s your willingness and ability to connect with your customers and address their needs that will increase their likelihood of staying satisfied longer\u2014which directly impacts your ability\nto retain and grow your market share.\nRespect your customers\u2019 time\nEach interaction you have with your customers should be natural, organic and personalized. Customers can sense scripted pitches and checklists, and they are more likely to respond positively to a real person than a script. Keep in mind that a captive\naudience is not necessarily the most appropriate opportunity to sell. Listen and act to resolve customers\u2019 needs\u00a0first\u00a0so they feel valued. Build trust and rapport\u2014explain what you can and will do each step of the way.\nAsk questions to uncover how they use your product or service and identify opportunities to educate them on how to get the most out of it going forward. Once you confirm their needs are met and thank them for their business, let them get on with their\nday. Respecting their time makes them feel appreciated. Conversely, over-solicitation of new offerings that don\u2019t fit their needs could push them to a competitor.\nStay relevant\nIt hardly needs to be said (but we\u2019re going to say it anyway)\u2014it\u2019s\u00a0absolutely\u00a0critical\u00a0to understand your customers and your competition. The marketplace is constantly changing,\nand what customers see, and experience elsewhere sets the bar for their expectations. Keeping pace with the market will help prevent customers from perceiving that there is something better out there. As new offers or solutions become available, be\nsure to enable your frontline to articulate the differences and/or provide counter offers to align with the perceived value of competitive products. Being agile in the face of market disruption will help you avoid the fate of once\u00a0iconic brands2\u00a0no\nlonger in existence.\nSo, let\u2019s sum it up. To reduce costly customer churn, the key is to stay focused on and connected with the customers you have, listen and adapt to their feedback, respect their time and ensure your offers and solutions are competitively relevant.\nFor help getting started, or for a more in-depth review of customer experience best practices, contact Alorica today.\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/#507c4acd5a8e\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/7-iconic-brands-no-longer-exist.asp\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

The key to being a lifelong learner is to also be a lifelong\nlistener. If you\u2019re able to really listen, you can focus on objectives and not be paralyzed by the status quo. Working her way up in the BPO industry, she started out as an agent and then was a team manager and an operations manager. She also worked as a trainer and in performance engineering before she moved into client solutions. Each new opportunity was a result\nof learning as much as she could in every role, and then pursuing the next challenge. Read her full Q&A below:Q: How have mentors made a difference in your career?A: My first office job was during college and involved filing papers. My boss was the comptroller, and he went above and\nbeyond teaching me about the business, which reinforced my hunger for lifelong learning. I ended up leading their accounting team! Since then, he has been a source of inspiration in mentoring my own teams. Whether someone reports to me or I work with\nthem, I want to be a positive influence in their lives and in their careers.\nQ: Looking back, did you see yourself reaching a director role?A: Yes, I did see myself in this role. I always had a path forward, but I think in life, your priorities change\nas you grow. When my daughter was 3, I decided to leave the workforce for a year and a half. I did it for her, and what I gained was tremendous. That time away improved me in many ways--my patience grew, my perspectives widened, my leadership and\nlistening skills improved, and my priorities about life changed.Q: As a leader, have you experienced a challenge that felt particular to being a woman? If so, how did you handle it, and what did you learn?A: In my life and career, I\u2019ve\nhad to overcome the challenge of perspective whether it\u2019s because I\u2019m female, a minority, my age, or all of the above. Respect is earned, and it can be earned pretty quickly. Know your business, use effective communication, and make fact-based\nrecommendations. This all leads to credibility and respect.Q: Would you change anything in your career trajectory? Why or why not?A: I\u2019ve made mistakes, I\u2019ve suffered heartaches, I\u2019ve fought hard and lost battles,\nbut I can\u2019t say I regret any of it. Every one of those things have been a learning experience, building character and tenacity. The fact that I have been in so many roles and have had the chance to look at the business from varied perspectives\nhas been positive and has let me make better decisions.Q: What excites you most about what you do at Alorica?A: Technology is progressing to take over tedious activities that allow people to spend their time in areas that provide\nmore value, and to think of solutions for the future. It\u2019s exciting, and absolutely a challenge. What\u2019s more enriching?

All was going smoothly, but two weeks prior to the end of new-hire training, the scope of work shifted. Alorica was\ntasked to focus instead on troubleshooting and technical support, in order to help reduce unnecessary service dispatches. And then, one week after the launch, the scope increased to include upselling of ancillary products/services.\nGood thing we\u2019re all about overcoming adversity\nTHE SOLUTION\nSometimes, You Need Reinforcements.\nChanges to the scope required us to make significant investments in additional coaching and leadership resources.\n\u2022 Sales-After-Service Coaches who specialize in Alorica\u2019s solutions-based selling methodology were assigned to assist agents with selling on service calls.\n\u2022 Business Intelligence Analysts were hired to review call recordings and compare time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for specific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch; the findings\nwere forwarded with suggested coaching methods to reduce the number of costly and unnecessary service dispatches.\n\u2022 Voice of the Customer Coaches specializing in VOC solutions for detractors were assigned to work with agents having challenges with specific customer dissatisfaction categories\nAnd Sometimes, You Need Added Bench Strength.\nIt was critical to ensure that growth did not come at the expense of performance, so Alorica made bench strength investments by enhancing Leadership Development and Succession Planning.\n\u2022 Early leadership assessments of all agents helped workforce planning understand the potential bench strength available for ramps\n\u2022 Financial incentives encouraged agents to enroll in Alorica\u2019s \u201cclear path\u201d program for leadership development and leadership certifications\n\u2022 Systematic succession planning established that managers would be eligible for promotion only when at least two of their subordinates were certified for promotion\n\u2022 Peer-to-Peer \u201cBuddy System\u201d was founded, where each role, function and manager were paired up with a high-performing manager within the client\u2019s internal contact centers\nAlorica drove ticket quality and ultimately minimized the expense of dispatching to the client\u2019s customers who truly required a service truck, by implementing a Ticket Quality Management group.\n\u2022 We hired Ticket Quality Managers as business intelligence analysts to audit calls and systems, identify outliers and coach for improvements for non-qualified dispatches\nPre-dispatch auditing identified Non-Qualified Dispatches prior to our client incurring the expense, by reviewing call recordings and comparing time spent in the interactive troubleshooting guide, pages visited, and systems accessed for\nspecific calls that resulted in non-qualified tech dispatch\nOutlier identification of the individual team (and site where the non-qualified dispatch originated) was gathered and analyzed\nOutlier coaching was conducted to improve behaviors and avoid future non-qualified dispatches\nTHE OUTCOME\nBeing Nimble and Staying Committed\u2014That\u2019s how We Earn a Win.\nThe ability to react quickly to change played a major part in finding success with (and for) our client. Thanks to significant investment in additional coaching and leadership resources, our partnership with the client helped to:\n\u2022 Exceed performance targets during and after launch\n\u2022 Drive improvements to service ticket quality\n\u2022 Minimize the expense of dispatching to customers \u2026talk about an insanely great ending.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc247", "title": "Social Care, Analytics and the Retail Customer Experience", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/social-care-analytics-and-the-retail-customer-experience\nSocial Care, Analytics and the Retail Customer Experience\nShare this\n\u201cKnow your customer\u201d has been a retail rallying cry for the past several decades. As businesses continue to evaluate and segment data to understand their customers\u2019 likely buying behaviors, they are rapidly replacing existing and outmoded product-centric programs with strategies focused on improving customer experience. The challenge retailers now face is how to enhance and personalize the customer experience, so as to generate an emotional bond between the consumer and the brand\u2014regardless of the communication channels employed throughout the relationship.\nBut let\u2019s step back for a moment and discuss the sweeping technological phenomena known as Social Media. What began as a way for people to stay connected has evolved into the dominant platform for information gathering. It has overthrown TV, radio and print as the preferred media source for a growing percentage of the population, and as \u2018cord cutters\u2019 continue to rise, advertising dollars are shifting away from cable and satellite services, and are being reallocated towards content consumption on increasingly sophisticated smart devices.\nAs these extensive technological changes continue, and growing consumer demand and the ever-increasing number of web-based communication platforms push e-commerce to center stage, it\u2019s imperative not to lose sight of drivers and indicators of buying behavior; this is particularly critical for Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Incorporating an intelligent social learning analytics platform into your existing CRM workflow (either on your own or through a customer care service provider) can help unlock valuable consumer data, including which social connections are most influential in their purchasing decisions. Insights from these analytics enable retailers to better know their customers and improve their experiences, and these insights also enable content providers to refine their products and to make smarter decisions based on customer preference. The emerging area of social care\u2014the efforts of caring for customers using social media\u2014is becoming a reality of day-to-day business operations for retailers. Marketers, retailers and marketplace merchants recognize the tremendous opportunity to enhance their customer journey by providing social media support, yet many struggle to prove the qualitative and quantitative value of their efforts.\nRetailers are being pushed into social care by engaged, social-savvy consumers who are posting questions of the retailers on social networks. The magnitude of these communications can seem overwhelming, with many companies struggling to successfully manage the volume of inquiries. The good news, is that not all social posts are created equal\u2014they don\u2019t all require a response. Robust listening platforms along with strategies to prioritize posts can make responding to social media communications manageable and effective.\u00a0In addition, while the goal is to serve customers in the channel of original contact, channel redirection will likely remain an issue for many retailers. Channel redirection occurs when a customer asks a question in a channel that isn\u2019t able to support an appropriate response. For example, if a customer asks a question on Twitter, the retailer may not be able to sufficiently address the inquiry in 140 characters or less. For some context, the previous sentence contains 146 characters. Likewise, a customer may need to share sensitive account information, thus requiring a more private, secure channel such as phone, chat or email.\nAlthough channel redirection ensures that customer questions are answered, it raises problems for measuring performance and customer satisfaction levels. But fear not! Fortunately, there are technology platforms for social customer care that are quickly evolving to address these issues.\nMetrics are an essential component when evaluating the effectiveness of a social care program. Traditional social media metrics (\u201clikes\u201d, \u201cfollowers,\u201d etc.) are valuable, but they don\u2019t necessarily provide insight into important areas\u2014like the level of customer satisfaction across multiple channels when channel redirection occurs. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics are important elements in a balanced social care effectiveness overview. Bringing this continually maturing channel into the framework of your support center will help solidify it as a valuable component of your customer retention strategy.\nLastly, consider partnering with your user community. It\u2019s a good idea to deploy YouTube customer support responses and developing guided self-help solutions to some of your most frequently asked questions (FAQs) when possible. As the second most-used search engine by Generation Z, YouTube can help you provide a concierge-level experience to a savvy consumer while reducing your company\u2019s overall support cost. Avenues for guided self-service, including video FAQs and tutorials, provide a path of great value for your users while allowing agents to focus on more involved user requests. This nets you a win/win outcome\u2014higher satisfaction levels for all customers, and a more strategic deployment of internal resources\u2014both of which can impact your bottom and top lines.\nToday\u2019s retailers stand at a crossroads\u2014evolve existing practices to meet and exceed the expectations of your customers, or stand by as your competition makes these changes and outperforms you in the marketplace. Don\u2019t let customers pass you by\u2014start planning your social care, channel redirection and guided self-service strategy today\u2014because your success depends on it!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc255", "title": "The Wait is Over: Live Chat Delivers Immediate Assistance and Drives Business Growth", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/the-wait-is-over-live-chat-delivers-immediate-assistance-and-drives-business-growth\nThe Wait is Over: Live Chat Delivers Immediate Assistance and Drives Business Growth\nShare this\nFor decades, companies have relied on partnerships with contact center outsourcing providers to handle customer questions and resolve issues quickly\u2014but the times, they are a changin\u2019. As the tidal shift toward digital, non-voice methods of\ncommunication continues, no channel has resonated more strongly with customers than live chat; in fact, a recent report found that demand for live chat features on company websites grew by 8.3% in 2017.1Live chat allows businesses to connect in real-time with visitors on their website. This robust channel meets online users where they are, providing instant assistance while the customer is immersed in that online ecosystem. The ability to get information\nquickly without leaving the keyboard is a key benefit; of those who utilize Live Chat, 79% do so because of the efficient nature of the platform.2\nIn fact, chat has the highest satisfaction rating among all customer service channels, with\u00a073% of online consumers giving it the thumbs up.3\u00a0Why\nso beloved? Here are four great reasons why customers embrace this customer service channel.\n#1: More convenient than drive-thru coffee\nAverage customer wait times are generally much shorter in live chat than when calling in to a support line, and customers can multitask while waiting for a response. The average response time is 2 minutes and 40 seconds, with the fastest response time being 7 seconds4\u2014compared\nto nearly 7 minutes of wait time when calling in to a contact center.5#2: More connected than an Instagram Influencer\nCustomer service reps using Live Chat can co-browse (view a customer\u2019s screen); this lets them see in real-time what they need to in order to troubleshoot the customer\u2019s online issues with speed and efficiency.6#3: More accurate than a laser-guided missileLive chat makes it easy for agents and customers to share SKU numbers, general account information, confirmation codes and other important textual data\u2014reducing the likelihood of errors.\n#4: More proactive than a devoted butlerLive Chat lets agents serve up special offers to loyal customers or offer assistance; meanwhile a live preview of what the customer is typing provides agents with in-depth insights\u2014before the customer has even finished typing!6\u00a0Research shows that customers are as equally receptive to chat as a marketing tool as they are to use it for online support, and chat has been shown to drive customer loyalty. Consider these facts:\n44% of online consumers7\u00a0say that having questions answered\nby a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer.79% of customers say they prefer live chat purely because of\u00a0the immediacy it offers\u00a0compared to other channels.863% of consumers say9\u00a0they are\u00a0more likely to make another purchase from a website that offers live chat.Live chat offers several benefits to e-commerce businesses and other companies. Online support tools enable the capture of valuable consumer data\u2014such as last page viewed and common questions\u2014that can reveal opportunities to improve the user\nexperience. In addition, agents\u2019 ability to handle multiple conversations simultaneously can reduce average interaction costs. Equally important, offering live chat can increase conversion rates and reduce abandonment, since 77% of customers won\u2019t make a purchase on a website if there\u2019s no live chat option available.10\nChat is increasingly relevant and valuable as a support and sales channel; not only does it enhance the customer journey (leading to increased efficiencies and streamlined handling), it provides an opportunity to maximize the customer experience by engaging visitors who might\u00a0otherwise have left your website without making a purchase or ever asking for help.\nAnd that\u2019s something worth talking about.\nSOURCEShttps://smallbiztrends.com/2018/01/live-chat-statistics.htmlhttps://www.revechat.com/blog/9-essential-live-chat-statistics-need-consider/https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/https://www.nextiva.com/blog/what-is-live-chat.htmlhttps://www.talkdesk.com/blog/how-long-do-callers-wait-before-they-hang-up/https://www.customerservicemanager.com/how-does-live-chat-increase-efficiency-while-reducing-costs/https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-power-of-live-chat-5-surprising-statistics-that-show-how-consumers-want-thei.htmlhttps://www.revechat.com/blog/9-essential-live-chat-statistics-need-consider/https://neilpatel.com/blog/live-chat-marketing/https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc259", "title": "MLBA Fundraisers: Our Worst 3 | Omaha 06", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/mlba-fundraisers-our-worst-3-omaha-06\nMLBA Fundraisers: Our Worst 3 | Omaha 06\nShare this\nby J. Scott Nebel, Omaha 06\nWhile any fundraising event that engages, unifies and raises money is a worthy effort, fundraising is not without its failures and frustrations. So here is ...\nPart 2 (click here for Part 1):\u00a0What Went Wrong\u2026?\u00a0 (Our Worst 3 Fundraisers)\nFlop Number\u00a03: Car Wash\nHose? Buckets? Soap? Towels? Let's go! Wait, where are the cars? A Car Wash without cars is just a Wash, only we're not really washing anything, so it's more of a \"_\", which I really don't know\nhow to pronounce, but I'm pretty sure a \"_\" doesn't make any money!\nWe have succeeded and failed with car washes, but failure was always a result of\u00a0the planning and execution. To avoid repeating our mistakes:\nTIP 1: Overbook! Always schedule\nmore than enough volunteers. You never know who is going to be sick, be pulled into emergency meetings, or get abducted by aliens (Seriously, it's been weeks. Where's Joe!)\nTIP 2: Promotion! We don't mean promoting a person to Executive Vice President\nof Corporate Suds and Towels, we mean make sure you build up the line of cars in advance. Put up flyers and start taking names a week ahead of time. This also helps you figure out\u00a0how much staff you will need.\nFlop Number 2: Off-Site Events\nOff-Site events after working hours can be a great idea: Getting employees interacting outside of work, getting the name Alorica out into the community\u2014it's a win-win, even if you make\nnothing. It's essentially advertising how much we care about our causes, as well as how much we care about our employees and each other. But ...\nTIP 1: Make it scalable! This part of the planning phase saved us in a recent bowling fundraiser flop.\nWhether we had 10 people show, or 100, we weren't going to lose money. We didn't really make any money either, but that's still marginally in the \"win\" column! (Now to reinvest those six pennies in the Penny War...)\nTIP 2: Again ... Promote it! We're still working out the kinks on cross-program promotion, but ensure you have active engagement\nacross all programs if you are opening an event up to more than one program to participate. A single flyer or email isn't as effective as people on the ground actively promoting it with multiple points of communication. Never underestimate the power of\na full song-and-dance number! Nobody will ever forget that day ... no matter how much I wish they would (Seriously, I probably should have realized you have to be able to sing and dance in a song-and-dance number. Also not really the best time for my\nfirst attempt at a back flip... I swear I'll pay for those damages!)\nNumber 1: Culture Kitchen\n\"Wait, didn't you say Culture Kitchen was one of your BEST ideas?\" \u00a0Yup.\n\"Are you losing your mind, or are you saying this is now your WORST idea?\"\u00a0 Yup.\nPricing\nis a dangerous game of Operation hooked up to a car battery ... One false move and you're on the ceiling picking up radio stations in your fillings! We've been there, and it's no fun dangling from florescent light ballasts. Instead, establish a foolproof\nplan.\nTIP1: I \"math-ed\" and you can, too!\u00a0 Here's the equation we feel leads to our most successful pricing:\n2c/p\naka Two times the Cost of the food, divided by the anticipated number of Participants.\nTIP 2: Perspiration over Participation Anticipation?\u00a0 Worry not! We believe we've cracked that code. Sure we don't have a crystal ball, or a time-traveling Delorian, but we are still holding out hope that a cyborg from the future will come back\nin time to tell us what everyone wants for lunch in 3 weeks. Totally could happen! Until then, we've found that anticipated participation usually comes in around 25-33% of total employees. Don't cook for all of your employees\n(at least not when there is a charge... FREE\u00a0food is a totally different animal, and it's not housebroken, not even a little!)\nYou'll get a feel for what meals are bigger hits as you\ntry some, but in general, 25-33% seems to be the average participation anytime we have a vendor, or become the vendor ourselves. Oh, and always round prices up \u2026 it\u2019s easier to give change for whole dollars!\nTo Avoid Fundraising Failures, Follow our Four \"P\"s:\nPlan it! (Price it and staff it appropriately, then execute the heck out of it!)\nPromote it! (Don't skimp on the flyers, the emails, or the dancing monkeys!)\nParty with it! (Make it Fun! Host it with a smile and make the fundraising a party!)\nPeanut Butter! (Yeah, I really only had three \"P\"s, sorry.)\nFor additional Questions on our Fundraising Successes and Failures, contact us at [email\u00a0protected]\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

As consumer demands continue to shift,\u00a0customer care solutions\u00a0teams are beginning to further rely on new and advanced technical support processes to better meet their patrons\u2019 needs. While these technologies create a faster, more flexible staff member,\nthey also require special attention in some instances, since a breakdown can disrupt the entire infrastructure.\nIT teams can be deployed to fix any internal hiccups in a\u00a0customer relationship management technology\u00a0system, but in terms of systematic processes,\nfinding the root cause to an issue is a different ball game. If a client support team can effectively troubleshoot its problems, they\u2019re more likely to improve upon their consumer satisfaction, among other things. With that in mind, here are\nfour tips for customer service representatives to keep in mind when attempting to troubleshoot a systematic issue:\n1. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions:\u00a0Assuming typically doesn\u2019t get anyone very far, so best practice \u2013 especially in the customer service industry \u2013 is to evaluate the situation from a big picture viewpoint. It\ncan be tempting for a seasoned client representative to jump to a conclusion about something when a customer contacts a business\u2019s service center, especially if the rep at hand has dealt with a similar situation before. However, the idea of\neffective troubleshooting is to find the root cause of the problem and then begin addressing the issue from that point on.\n2. Remain attentive throughout the entire process:\u00a0The parlance of a\u00a0BPO technical support\u00a0representative\nwill likely differ from that of an everyday customer calling in with a question or concern. It\u2019s important for staff members to remain vigilant on the back end so that nothing falls through the cracks. The way a client describes something may\nmake sense to him or her, but it very well could be the wrong way to\u00a0describe something from a business standpoint. Alternatively, a technical support team also needs to play the role of translator when speaking with a patron, otherwise the internal\nvernacular may confuse the customer at hand.\n3. Manage issues in order of their importance:\u00a0In a perfect world, nothing would ever go wrong with a customer service team\u2019s IT infrastructure, therefore eliminating any issues that stem from said hiccups. However, since the\nhuman element is a constant in the client services equation, there are bound to be mistakes in the process. As a result, management needs to teach its team how to prioritize effectively, or else the most important issues won\u2019t get taken care\nof first.\n4. Cover all bases before taking action:\u00a0This can be particularly tricky because the modern day consumer wishes to have his or her problem addressed in an immediate fashion, so it\u2019s hard not to understand why a\u00a0contact center service\u00a0would want to be as quick as possible in getting back to the patron. Yet, it\u2019s important that reps evaluate the situation from a macro level. An effective troubleshooting process starts\nwith the identification of all the concerns at hand and then logically working through them all. It can be a longer process, but it will teach reps to double-check, cross reference and test things before the problem is addressed.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

They discuss the feedback economy and how to leverage customer feedback to improve the\ncustomer experience\nLISTEN TO PODCAST\nTop Takeaways:\nCompanies spend billions of dollars building their brands, retail stores, and products. But, when it comes down to the moment that\u2019s most impactful for a customer, it usually comes down to their interaction with a customer service agent.\nThe feedback economy shifts the service model on its head. There is less focus on broadcasting why your company is great. The focus is on listening to the customer, understanding their pain points, and creating more systemic changes to address them.\nThere are thousands of avenues for empowered consumers to make their voices heard. You need the right tools to harness all this feedback and take action.\nSocial channels don\u2019t discriminate. Companies have to learn to change their processes, technologies, and products to be responsive. The customers need to be the center of a company\u2019s strategy.\nTechnology is only a piece of what it takes to get the customer service equation right. You need the right judgment and empathy to take action and help your customers.\nCustomer service happens throughout the entire customer journey. The overall user experience is a function of an ecosystem of partners for delivery. Employees, and in some instances, companies need to collaborate to create a great customer experience.\nPolicies should be rules or guidelines that empower employees to help the customer instead of hindering service.\nQuotes:\n\u201cThe customer is the center of everything that you do.\u201d\n\u201cAlways put the customer and their voice as your north star in how you think about providing service.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it comes down to listening. Leverage your socials and content reviews as business assets.\u201d\n\u201cCustomer\nfeedback is your biggest resource.

It\u2019s been shown that:\nA 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25%\nBrand promoters are worth 3x more than passive customers, and 7x more than detractors\nCompanies with greater retention rates account for 75% of that additional value, and encouraging a passive customer to become a promoter is roughly 3x more valuable than convincing a detractor to become passive\nThe truth is, many companies have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers. So what\u2019s the solution? How can you keep your business in motion and on an upward trend by not only bringing on new customers, but maintaining the customer relationships\nyou already possess?\nSimple. Analytics.\nIt\u2019s Good to Get Analytical.\nAnalytics are critical for maintaining and growing your customer base because they play a large role in making those customers feel cared for. Analytics allow you to reach the right customers at\nthe right time, increase your propensity to connect, convert and ensure customers are more likely to stay in contact with your brand. In addition, analytics let companies personalize the customer experience, reducing the need for mass sales pitches or\nblanket selling.\nOur extensive analytical capabilities track (among other metrics) time of day, lead demographics and scoring, bucket reports (funneling customers to help drive conversion) and number of call attempts. And yet, analytics are practically\nuseless unless you can truly put them to work.\nActionable Analytics: Why Analysis Matters\nThe sad truth is that analytics are often only reported, and not analyzed. This leads to lowered effectiveness for the company as well as decreased revenue opportunities,\nas potential sales are lost by continuing to mass-sell (versus targeting preferred demographics).\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Data enables companies to build warm lead lists, predict propensity to connect and increase first-attempt\nconnects, all of which can help increase your sales results as much as 20-25%.\nThe Bottom Line\nAccess to analytics is important, but analyzing the analytics \u2013 putting the data to work for you \u2013 that\u2019s where the difference is made. It\u2019s all about predictive models that leverage\ndiverse sources of data such as text, survey responses, and customer profiles. Our Center of Analytical Excellence has access to data from over 300 million households, which, when coupled with Alorica\u2019s 30 years of experience, allows us to fully\nanalyze and interpret information \u2013 and not just merely spit out numbers.\nThat\u2019s how you gain customers.

Ignite Your Employer Brand.", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/want-to-recruit-millennials-ignite-your-employer-brand\nWant to Recruit Millennials? Ignite Your Employer Brand.\nShare this\nAre Millennials from Mars? There has been so much discussion about how to hire and retain this group\u2013which is almost 80 million strong now in the U.S. alone\u2013that one begins to wonder if they\u2019re from another planet. While understanding and decoding this group is paramount, there are ways to create a talent attraction strategy that appeals to them.1 The most important weapon is your employer brand.What is an employer brand\u2026and why should you care?As a textbook definition, your employer brand is your reputation as an employer. It reflects what your employees and the community think about\nyou. At its core, though, your employer brand is the story of your people behind the scenes.2It sheds light on the real reasons why they choose to work for you. Why do they get out of bed in the morning and go to work? What do they get out of it? And, when all of those people get together, what is the working environment and culture\nlike? The employer brand and employee value proposition\u00a0have become increasingly important as unemployment decreases and job seekers have more\nchoices than ever before.3 So they research. And they ask questions. And they talk to their friends and neighbors. And they\u2019ve decided that they won\u2019t work for a company with a bad reputation. In fact, in one study, almost\n70% of candidates\u00a0said they wouldn\u2019t take a job with a company that had a bad reputation, even if they were unemployed.4 \u00a0So how do you create a great employer brand? \u00a0 Building a truly compelling employer brand takes time. It\u2019s not a one-time project that can be completed in two weeks. However, there are four keys to building a strong employer brand over time.\nKey component #1:\u00a0Take time for self-reflectionEvery company has an identity. \u00a0It will typically include elements of your brand\u2019s purpose, your mission and overall core values. As you consider your employer brand, reflect upon those elements and really get to know yourself. What\u2019s\nimportant to your company, your CEO, your shareholders? What type of culture do you have (and do you want to have)? Is yours a company where people actually want to work? Why or why not? \u00a0 This is not a time for rose-colored glasses. Look in the mirror and examine the core elements of your company, warts and all. Consider point #2 as you do this.\nKey component #2:\u00a0Authenticity above all elseCandidates\u2013particularly millennials\u2013hate liars. Don\u2019t try to be something you\u2019re not. The whole point of this exercise is to match who you are as a company to what your target candidates are seeking and to make a quality match\nthere. As you develop your employer brand, stay true to who you are and wrap your branding around that.\nKey component #3:\u00a0Develop a purpose-driven EVPYour Employee Value Proposition (EVP) consolidates your employer brand into easy-to-understand bites. Millennials in particular are looking for trust and collaboration; strong relationships from their co-workers and their supervisors; engagement;\nauthentic feedback about their performance; and opportunities for growth. Does your EVP align to that?\nKey component #4:\u00a0Become a great storytellerYou have a great employer brand and compelling EVP, but don\u2019t believe the hype. Kevin Costner was wrong. In the real world, \u201cif you build it\u201d people will not come. You need to become a great storyteller to capture the attention of millennials\nand bring them to you. \u00a0 There\u2019s a \u201csecret sauce\u201d for how do this, and of course, it helps if your employer brand\u2019s voice and creative designs appeal to\nyour target candidates.5 But, make sure your designs reflect your company, too (see point #2). Once your EVP and stories are ready, include them in all components of your talent acquisition strategies and engage millennials where they congregate\n(e.g., social media). \u00a0 \u00a0 As companies fish in the same millennial talent pool, it will be crucial for you to differentiate yourself. By leveraging a compelling employer brand, you can do just that. \u00a0 SOURCES\n1.\u00a0Decoding Millennials, Alorica, 2017. https://alorica.com/insights/resource/decoding-millennials/.2.

We are a company of people, a company of ethics and a company that believes our first responsibility\nis to ensure that every Alorican is engaged, inspired and nurtured to succeed.\nAs Alorica\u2019s Chief Culture Officer, I don\u2019t take this responsibility lightly. And I know everything we do starts with our Core Values: Be Connected. Be Bold. Be Relentless. Be True. With COVID-19 forcing many of us to work\nfull-time from our homes, these values have taken on an even greater significance. They\u2019ve kept us united even as we physically work apart, and we\u2019ve taken them to heart as we continue to deliver insanely great customer service for many\nessential businesses\u2014including contact tracing, food delivery and content moderation.\nAs a minority-owned business, Alorica understands and can relate to the challenges faced by underserved populations and communities. It\u2019s why we stand up for those less fortunate, and it\u2019s what led us to launch TIDE: Together for Inclusion, Diversity & Equity.\nWe\u2019ve created regional TIDE Teams that lead local sites in conversations about the causes and issues that matter most to them. We\u2019ve facilitated respectful, fair and open dialogues about tough issues like racism, bias, sexual and gender\nidentity, mental health and more. And through them all, we\u2019ve learned about our people. We\u2019ve listened to their stories. And we\u2019ve grown\u2014together.\nWe take great pride in empowering our people to care for one another. Our non-profit partner, Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA), has supported team members around the world in times\nof crisis. Instead of corporate headquarters dictating where to give charitable contributions, each of our chapters has the autonomy to support their local communities\u2014and to-date, we\u2019ve given out almost $5M in grants\nin six different countries! Over the course of the pandemic, it has been our duty and privilege to donate time and resources to our local communities\u2014supporting causes and individuals in need.\nAll of these programs are certainly good for the soul\u2014but are they good for the business? In one emphatic word, YES! Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives have had a tremendous effect on Alorica\u2019s ability to hire and retain top talent. We\u2019re committed to Impact Sourcing\u2014through which we support economically-disadvantaged communities by offering local residents career opportunities.\nGiving people the chance to earn a living, support their families and make a difference in their neighborhoods is what it\u2019s all about; people naturally want to work for companies that do the right thing\u2014and so what\u2019s good for the\ncommunity is also good for the bottom line.\nAnd it\u2019s not just our people that care about our efforts\u2014our partners do too! Many of our clients also make strong commitments to CSR, and they want to team up with like-minded corporations. When culture and views on social responsibility\nalign, great partnerships are forged\u2014and we have been extremely fortunate to foster incredible relationships based on shared values.\nBeing insanely great starts with being exceptionally responsible, and it\u2019s an honor to lead Alorica\u2019s efforts in serving the common good. I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in a short amount of time, but we\u2019ve only\njust begun\u2014and there are awesome things to come!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Within only days, we\u2019ve successfully transitioned thousands of agents to an at-home environment\u2014and more\nare coming online each day! We\u2019re thrilled to take this opportunity to share new stories filled with passion, performance and very long hours\u2014and acknowledge accomplishments that truly shatter the status quo!\nOur entire Austin site has converted to a work-at-home environment! And it wasn\u2019t easy. Starting last Sunday, Sr. Site Director Tony Pi\u00f1on, his management team and the client were on-site\ngetting systems ready. The team then spent all of Monday and Tuesday deploying hundreds of production, ABAY and support staff into the at-home environment. Tony shared that the tremendous achievement wouldn\u2019t have been possible without everyone\nbanding together\u2014including the entire Austin management team, all the incredible agents, corporate partners and executive leadership.\nNext up, our Honduras site was just beginning to celebrate a partnership with a brand-new client, when the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 threatened to bring business to a halt. But\u2014our team snapped\ninto action and immediately started testing remote access by sending one agent home to log-in. When that worked, they mobilized a few more agents, and once they were confident in the solution, they contacted the client to share the good news. The\nclient was incredibly impressed with their proactive resolution, and soon the rest of the pieces fell into place. Site leadership determined which agents in the site met the requirements to work from home, launched training for the eligible employees\n(two weeks early, in fact!), and transitioned a great number of employees to Work-from-Home. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we have an incredible story to share from our Newport News site! After quickly surveying their entire team to confirm who met the technology requirements to work remotely, site leaders made\nit happen in record time\u2014and transitioned more than a hundred employees in just a couple days!

Online attacks take place every 39 seconds; and a staggering 59% of U.S. teens have been cyberbullied or threatened online2.\nIn just the past year alone, 69% of people have experienced online risks, including cyberbullying, hate speech, and threats of violence3.But it\u2019s not just people who are at risk\u2014over 55% of companies reported an increase in fraud-related losses4.\u00a0Companies also suffer regulatory and financial\npenalties from data breaches, from the 2014 data breach that cost Home Depot $179 million to Target\u2019s more recent $18.5M payout in 20175.Social media companies have found themselves particularly liable in recent years. The FTC regularly imposes multi-million dollar fines against them\u2026and contrary to common assumptions, Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency\nAct does not provide protection from being held liable for bad behaviors on their platforms6.And it\u2019s not just steep fines (and the bad publicity that comes with them) that companies have to worry about\u2014because with each incident, reputations suffer. Bearing in mind that approximately one in five customers would stop shopping with\nretailers whose data was hacked and stolen, online risks can have devastating consequences to a company\u2019s bottom line, from the largest big-box retailer to the local boutique.Trust & Safety strategies\u2014of which content moderation is an essential tool\u2014can help keep company information accurate and customers safe, even in an ever-changing, crowded online landscape.Understanding Legal and Reputational Risks (and How to Prevent Them)With so much at stake, companies need to prioritize risk mitigation. And to effectively meet the expectations of consumers, employees, and investors, that means adopting effective risk management programs based on actionable insights.But how can companies determine what their risks are, let alone know how to adopt formal programs that touch every aspect of their organizations?To help guide companies towards successful risk management efforts, we hosted a webinar dedicated to assessing organizational legal and reputational risks for actionable insights, featuring Adam Dorfman, VP of Product at Reputation.com, Joe Buggy, Alorica\u2019s\nHead of Trust & Safety, and Harry Folloder, SVP Chief Digital Officer at Alorica.The spirited, roundtable discussion covered a wealth of information, from explaining the nuances of assessing risk and best practices to AI\u2019s role in reputation management. Key takeaways included:\nLegal vs. reputational:\nAs exemplified by Home Depot and Target, legal risks can include lawsuits, judgements, and financial harm; reputational risks include the erosion of trust and customer losses.\nProactive risk assessment: Companies that regularly conduct risk assessments can stay one step ahead; this means seeking out customer feedback versus waiting for negative content to flourish online. Active monitoring and listening to customers\nin real time builds trust and helps ensure that negative, reputation-damaging online feedback is addressed quickly and effectively. Risk management adoption: Using frameworks helps companies decide how to approach risk management, including the total number of risks, percentage of organization affected, how have risks been mitigated historically, how many risks are monitored,\nand how many are mitigated. And once risks are assessed, have a process in place to help you plot and understand the scope each presents to the organization as a whole. Best Practices: By responding quickly to customer feedback online\u2014within 24 hours for negative feedback, and two days for positive feedback\u2014companies show customers that they\u2019re listening to them, which positively impacts\nboth sentiment and retention. The role of AI: While AI can be a great tool for businesses, it also allows spam to proliferate; companies can circumvent potential risks by shifting to video testimonials, confirmed customer prioritization, or just by adding check marks to\ncustomers or purchases to add validation. \u00a0Just Do SomethingPerhaps the biggest takeaway from our panel discussion was that when it comes to mitigating risks, companies can\u2019t sit on the sidelines. They must act\u2014and act fast\u2014or they\u2019ll face serious consequences.Acting starts with companies understanding that there are external forces out there that can do serious harm to their bottom lines, and tracking risks accordingly. That doesn\u2019t have to mean creating Risk Mitigation departments\u2014simply asking\nexploratory questions to identify risks and creating a spreadsheet to track them can put companies on the path to less risks and happier customers.

I\u2019m so grateful to work at a company like Alorica where I\u2019m personally encouraged to be bold, and my\nteams run with it when I challenge them to do the same. Because after 30 years in the biz, I can say with certainty that YOU are your best advocate, and you have the power to make things happen for yourself.\nWhen I first started out as a call center agent in my 20\u2019s, I didn\u2019t know it would take me to where I am today\u2014the President of North America and Europe Operations for one of the largest digital CX providers in the world.\nBut I saw others shatter the status quo before me (and certainly after me!) by first delivering on their promise and then going for those new, kinda scary and bigger opportunities. I decided to follow that example and lead in the same way. So, don\u2019t\nwait for someone to come tap you. Never say \u201cno\u201d to a chance to learn more skills. Make mistakes, learn from them, and move on. As I often say, \u201cget over it.\u201d You never know where the next opportunity lies when you do these\nthings. Most importantly, don\u2019t follow a career path; build the one that\u2019s meant for you.\nThis month is about honoring the women in our lives and committing to #BreakTheBias\u2014the theme celebrated around the world for International Women\u2019s Day. Furthering diversity and inclusion\u00a0is,\nand should be, a top priority for us all. Besides being the right thing to do, it enhances our business, company culture, and especially our people. At Alorica, we even have the numbers to prove it\u2014our female population has grown since last\nyear with now 62% of our global workforce made up of women. Not only that, but as the largest certified and award-winning minority-owned BPO, we have also increased the number of minorities within our U.S. workforce to 71%. Why are these facts important?\nBecause strong representation of groups, such as women and minorities, matter to our employees, our clients and our customers\u2014even more so now as we look toward the future of work. And it matters to me that as a company, we are making progress.\nThere\u2019s much work to be done, but we are taking meaningful steps in the right direction.\nAs we continue Women\u2019s History Month, I\u2019d like to take a moment to celebrate some qualities that make women special: how much we care as well as our passion, sensitivity and resilience when dealing with change. These qualities, which have\nsometimes been misconstrued in the workplace as weakness, actually demonstrate our strength. We aren\u2019t afraid to show these skills with conviction, strong execution and thoughtful leadership, and sometimes wearing bright-red heels.

But to attract and retain this diverse talent, we need to\nfocus on creating a culture of inclusivity that encourages individuality. Here are some of the benefits of being part of a global company with an inclusive mindset.\u00a01. Exploring new markets with confidence\u00a0We are in the era where global presence has become a defining element of success. A diverse talent pool enables companies to harness the cultural knowledge of their employees, thereby understanding the local nuances that\nare an integral part of consumer behaviors and preferences. This helps brands penetrate new markets effectively and stay ahead of anticipated risks while exploring new opportunities. Our operational footprint across NA, APAC, LATAM and EMEA enable\nus to best support our customers worldwide with\u00a0#LimitlessPossibilities\u00a02.\nEmpowering growth\nEmployees want to do their best work for leaders they trust and respect. An inclusive leadership team is a key selling point for recruiting best-in-class talent and boosting a company\u2019s reputation as an employer of choice. Employees excel\nin their performance when they feel encouraged to be their true selves in their workplace, and when they see diversity within their leadership team. Alorica is proud to be a certified diverse supplier with strong minority and female representation\naround the world. Last year, we promoted 5,000 employees globally and more than half were women. We were also specifically recognized earlier this year for our Achievement in Promoting & Developing Women. #EnhancedPerformance3.

By providing opportunities to local employees from all walks of life\u2014different ages, ethnicities, genders, interests,\nskills, education\u2014to interact with, solve problems for customers, and grow professionally, companies have a positive ripple effect that impacts communities. This is seen through job creation, economic development, corporate social responsibility\ncontributions and more.

As is often the case with new technology, many initial chatbots were created for fun, but they\u2019re now being\nused to enhance the workplace, particularly in HR departments. How you ask? Job interviews can be incredibly stressful for applicants. Chatbots provide a level of comfort and, ironically, emotional distance that can promote efficient and relaxed conversations.\nRecruitment chatbots can stage initial interviews that are direct, friendly, and minimally intimidating. It\u2019s also simply a better, faster and easier way to connect with qualified candidates. This is a win-win for both applicants and HR teams.\nAt Alorica, we have been testing this method of recruitment in the Philippines by embedding the technology onto the Alorica Philippines Facebook page, conducting screenings via Facebook Messenger. To measure the effectiveness of this method, the technology\nhad to solve the following challenges: maximize online recruiting channels; generate inactive leads; and reduce manual phone call outreach to candidate leads. In the span of just three months, the results have already been overwhelmingly positive! During\nthe testing period, 3,088 candidates were interviewed, compared to 966 during the same period a year prior. There was a savings of more than 1,200 recruiting man hours and the cost per hire reduced by 84 percent. Additionally, online channel conversion\nrate was up to 14-16 percent compared to traditional channels at 4-6 percent. \u00a0 To sum it up, chatbots have completely changed the way Alorica thinks about recruiting. By implementing the technology, we have not only saved money and man hours, but\nallowed us to connect with qualified candidates who resonated with this recruitment strategy. It just goes to show, the trick to getting face time is a little screen time. \u00a0 Alorica is one of the biggest outsourcing employers in the region with 17\nsites strategically located across metro Manila and provincial regions.

As physicians - and fluid regulations - continue to restrict access to outside reps, the industry has had to shift to accommodate doctors who are spending more time with patients and less time being solicited.\nAccording to a study by Doctors.net.uk,\u00a052 percent of the more than 1,0001\u00a0general\npractitioners surveyed did not see any pharmaceutical sales representatives in a typical week, while just 26 percent only saw one rep in the same time period. No-see doctors are impacting the medical field in a way that is negative for big pharmaceutical\ncompanies, but as physicians spend less time in front of sales reps, they can focus more on patient health. A general lack of time was cited as the No. 1 reason why doctors don't see sales reps anymore, with 38 percent of respondents saying they were\ntoo busy to meet with sales executives. Another 15 percent said that seeing reps was against practice policy.\nNo-see doctors mean industry wide changes This shift is affecting all aspects of the health care industry, not just sales and marketing reps. Patients are beneficiaries of no-see doctors because they see more individual attention, but on the other\nhand, practices aren't able to take in as many patients as they used to, hence limiting business to a certain extent. On the back end of operations, doctors now have to manually enter patient information into electronic health record databases and\nsubmit prescriptions themselves, so a higher level of accountability has been placed on physicians as a result, according to Clark Ridge, vice president of client health care services at Alorica.\n\"The level of accuracy, receiving greater scrutiny, I think you're just saying spend a little more time with each patient asking questions and getting information right,\" Ridge said. \"To a doctor, though, it's had a negative impact on their ability to\ngenerate revenue because it's reduced the number of people they're able to see.\"\nRidge added that as insurance companies adopt new policies, such as reimbursement rates determined by patient satisfaction scoring, the trickle-down effect of no-see and hard-to-see doctors may be more wide-sweeping than first thought. No longer are general\nphysician practices overstaffing themselves to the point where people are in the waiting room for long periods of time before they see a doctor.\nOutsourced assistance could prove useful Now that doctors are spending more time with each patient, chances of retention are higher due to a more personalized experience. On the front end of doctor's office visits, practices have been implementing\nstreamlined services for patients to check in and schedule appointments. For example, individuals can now go online and book a time to visit their physician, and when they show up for their consultations, they can check-in using an automated kiosk.\nAlthough the adoption of the electronic sign-in has been slow, Ridge said it could greatly benefit the practices that implement such systems.\n\"To really take advantage of efficiency, outsourcing some of that interaction to a group of individuals that don't have to be on-site and can capture the information is a much less costly alternative,\" he said. \"Where completeness and accuracy are key,\noutsourcing is a great option.\"\nSOURCES1http://www.pmlive.com/blogs/digital_intelligence/archive/2012/aug_2012/uk_doctors_pharma_sales_reps_digital_418566\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc314", "title": "Outsourcing: The Cure for What Ails Your Company", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/outsourcing-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-company\nOutsourcing: The Cure for What Ails Your Company\nShare this\nIn 2015, over 2.3 million jobs were outsourced1. It\u2019s an increasingly popular way to do business; by freeing up internal resources,\ncosts are reduced and customers are afforded access to technology, tools and best practices that aren\u2019t generally available internally.\nTop providers in our industry have years of experience and are fast, agile and adaptable. But how do you know if outsourcing is the right solution for you? Or when it is the right solution?\nRead on, dear friends. Read on.\nSix Scenarios When Outsourcing Makes Sense\n1. You want to retain customers.\nTHE SITUATION\nYour current customers are happy, but your business is struggling to maintain \u2013 and improve \u2013 an already exceptional level of service.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBusiness Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies build and develop multi-skilled agent profiles that allow you to continue offering superior customer care while exploring all-new service solutions \u2013 chat, video, etc. (often, platforms that have not\nyet been considered).\n2. You want to acquire new customers.\nTHE SITUATION\nBringing in new business generates revenue, but you may need additional guidance in recruiting and retaining top sales agents who can bolster your bottom line.\nTHE SOLUTION\nWhile focusing on creating the best experiences for your end customer, BPO companies can provide resources that get the job done and drive exceptional business outcomes \u2013 as it turns out, we are experts at recruiting and retaining the right agent\nprofile to meet your business needs. Keep in mind \u2013 companies that utilize strong omnichannel customer engagement strategies see, on average, a 9.5% increase in annual revenue2.\n3. Specialized training requires detailed education.\nTHE SITUATION\nCertain products and services simply take more time to fully grasp. Training classes can be time-consuming and resource-draining, and often there\u2019s just too much for one trainer to know \u2013 but additional coaching can\u2019t be supported by\nyour in-house team.\nTHE SOLUTION\nWith a BPO company, you can employ a wide range of skills and services. We partner with our clients to fully develop training curriculums with a wide variety of courses, and hire dedicated recruiters and QA analysts to ensure goals are met.\n4. Seasonal ramps are just that. Seasonal.\nTHE SITUATION\nHigh-peak seasons mean all hands on deck. But you most likely don\u2019t have hundreds of extra seats in your internal centers to handle the additional, often unpredictable, push.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBPO companies are there precisely when you need them. They can handle the size of the ramp effectively, providing you with options in multiple time zones, and facilitating brick-and-mortar, work-at-home and blended agent models to build tailored solutions.\nWe excel at finding you tenured resources and complementary seasonal programs, so that you\u2019re always staffed with the most qualified talent.\n5. Rapid growth is not without its pitfalls.\nTHE SITUATION\nAs your company expands, you may find yourself needing fast \u2013 and thoughtful \u2013 solutions to fill resources and maintain customer service expectations. But when service is being backfilled by 6. internal workers, your business simply loses\nthe ability to train new people to plug the gaps and keep up with demand.\nTHE SOLUTION\nA BPO provider takes away the pressures of you having to supply all the answers, because of the flexibility built into the outsourcing model. BPOs give you instant access to scalability, letting you ramp up and down quickly and allowing you to return\nto focusing solely on the business, in-house processes or other ventures.\nYou don\u2019t have all the tech you need.\nTHE SITUATION\nIt\u2019s all about analytics and omnichannel solutions; if your in-house analytics are not customer-focused, you could receive unreliable data and metrics. And if your customer service is restricted to a single channel, you\u2019re missing out on opportunities\nto enhance customer experience and loyalty.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBPOs have deep experience with analytics \u2013 going beyond the raw data and providing useful analysis that yields deeper partnerships and stronger metrics. And by being able to blend agents on multiple customer service channels \u2013 voice, email,\nchat, text, video and social media \u2013 customer loyalty to your brand can be enhanced for the long-term.\n***\nYour company is constantly trying to meld customer needs with your unique business culture and values. Outsourcing can help you establish a seamless, blended partnership that benefits both sides.\nReach out to us any time,\nand let\u2019s talk about how Alorica can make a win-win situation happen for you.\nSources\n1 \u00a0http://www.statisticbrain.com/outsourcing-statistics-by-country/\n2 \u00a0http://aberdeen.com/research/8675/ra-omni-channel-experience/content.aspx\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

This is where microlearning comes in \u2013 it meets this expectation of consuming information, while increasing learner satisfaction. Defined as a way of teaching and delivering content in small bursts, microlearning has been a key success factor for our agents and clients including a major retail pharmacy provider.\nManaging millions of customer prescriptions daily, this pharmacy provider began to experience some challenges with prescription fulfillment compliance. The impacts were significant, ranging from financial loss to medication abuse, and in this highly-regulated industry, it was simply unacceptable. To fix the problem, Alorica was tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that not only improved process compliance, but would also increase employee interest and attention. The solution? You guessed it, microlearning.\nInstead of a traditional four-hour re-training intervention using a PowerPoint presentation, we implemented microlearning \u2014 where we created a customized, brief, 10-minute video allowing agents to understand the importance of customer verification. In doing so, this helped close the culture gap to better align with client expectations. A little over a month into the program, we began collecting data on the effectiveness of the program and the results spoke for themselves \u2013 the compliance rating improved to as high as 96%. There was also a cost saving \u2014 with an average of four training hours per full-time employee.\nThanks to this new training method, the team that underwent this pilot program greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional re-training tools. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning\u2019s digestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information, while encouraging participation and conversation during the sessions. Furthermore, these microlearnings were cost-effective, resulting in cutting development costs (i.e. creating training collateral, salary for trainers, etc.).\nWe know your business has unique customer needs and we\u2019re here to make sure our agents who provide customer service on your behalf are fully informed and engaged to make lives better, one interaction at a time.

As Everest Group\u2019s analysts observed, outsourcing is more cost-effective for companies no matter the economic climate. Outsourcing Trust & Safety initiatives, including content moderation\nand content management, empowers multi-dimensional, multilingual content moderation at scale\u2014something we, as a veteran BPO industry leader, can easily attest to. As we\u2019ve found, by acting as an extension of a client\u2019s\nbusiness, we\u2019ve been able to provide seamless support while improving the customer experience without incurring risks for our clients.\nIdentify the most viable shoring mix. Going offshore (and nearshore) for Trust & Safety efforts makes dollars and sense per Everest Group\u2019s analysis. As they note, even large tech firms have been shifting their content\nmanagement and related needs to cost-effective locations in APAC and LATAM. In our experience, by leveraging our global workforce and delivery models, including work-at-home, hybrid, and gig workforce solutions, clients can empower safe\nspaces online, as well as maximize ROI in any economic climate.\nLeverage alternative talent models for non-sensitive work types within Trust & Safety. Having a diverse workforce mix makes content moderation and other Trust & Safety initiatives manageable; and, as Everest Group rightly notes,\nhybrid workforces featuring full-time and gig workers have become increasingly common in the post-Covid-19 landscape. Outsourcing optimized, global workforces like Alorica\u2019s empowers companies to safeguard online communities with\nease; we also invest heavily in our employee wellbeing to ensure that our talent is always up to the task.\nAdopt a pragmatic approach to digital investments. Large technology firms often partner with third-party service providers to leverage their talent pools and harness new technologies. Outsourcing, as Everest Group illustrates, makes\nit possible for companies of all sizes to harness cutting-edge technologies to improve content moderation and customer support simultaneously. Alorica\u2019s clients and their customers enjoy the latest technology and optimal support\nwithout impacting their bottom lines.\nBut this is just the beginning, per Everest Group, because outsourcing Trust & Safety also helps reduce attrition, creates more resilient workforces, and reduces portfolio risks\u2014all things we couldn\u2019t agree with more.\u00a0\u00a0Want to Learn More?\u00a0If you\u2019ve got questions about offshoring, workforce optimization, Trust & Safety, or just need great support yesterday, we\u2019ve got answers.Get in touch\nto find your perfect solution!\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Challenge accepted.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nIntroduce \u2018microlearning\u2019 to revolutionize training protocols\nBoost KPI scores\nWin over a skeptical client\nTHE OUTCOME\nPilot-site process compliance hit 96% to goal 60 days after training, besting non-pilot sites by as much as 62%\nCost savings: on average, we reduced retraining time by as much as 80% per full-time employee\nMicrolearning content was integrated right from the start in the new-hire training program\nTHE CHALLENGE\nConvince the Client. Boost the Scores. Win the Day.\nThis one was a bit tricky. We were tasked with delivering an interventional learning approach that needed to improve process compliance as well as keep employee interest and attention. More than 95% of the pilot site\u2019s team was made up\nof Millennials, and so applying a teaching method that would resonate was of supreme importance.\nFurthermore, our mission also entailed boosting KPI scores. Toss in a client that was skeptical of new approaches to training, and you could say we had a lot to prove using microlearning.\nChallenge accepted.\nTHE SOLUTION\nBetter Technology. Better Retention. Better Scores.\nInstead of traditional classroom retraining intervention marathons, we championed microlearning: a short, animated video that focused\non client-specific goals (in this case, the importance of improving compliance). Brief, animated stories assisted agents with understanding the importance of customer verification, and in doing so helped close a culture gap to better align with client\nexpectations.\nTHE OUTCOME\nMicrolearning Makes Its Mark.\nThanks to the new training method, the pilot site greatly outperformed other internal sites using traditional retraining methods. Playing a major role in its success is microlearning\u2019s\ndigestible nature; these short videos help agents retain 20% more information while encouraging participation and conversation during training sessions.

I applied a few times, and when I finally got the opportunity, it was awesome! Then\nwith some encouragement, I transitioned into operations\u2014first as an Operations Manager\u2014and have since been growing within the organization.\nWhat\u2019s an example of a choice you made that you are proud of or that served as a turning point in your career? Taking risks. Too often, we make \u2018safe\u2019 decisions\u2014but the times that I have taken\nrisks and embraced opportunities outside of my comfort zone have turned out to be game changers!\nCould you offer any professional advice to employees who are just starting out?Just be you.\u00a0You are where you are for a reason, so step up and show up!

Back in the day, the biggest challenge I faced was not\nhaving the appropriate tools and training for the job I wanted. My transition into a leadership role was tough. So, I went ahead and learned how I thought best. I made sure to sit next to a genius workforce person, so I could learn terminology, computations\nand how to optimize tools. I learned from leaders and my peers around me, and never stopped inquiring. I watched and I asked\u2014and I still do that to this day. \u00a0 I always look at everyone as my equal, no matter the title or experience. Today,\nwhen I present to organizations, I find very few women at the table\u2014but I tell myself that my voice will stand out and be heard no matter what.\nWhat is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?

{"_id": "doc337", "title": "3 Principles of Social Media Customer Service", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/3-principles-of-social-media-customer-service\n3 Principles of Social Media Customer Service\nShare this\nMultichannel customer service is no longer a luxury that progressive companies use, it's become an industry norm. A study conducted by social analytics company Simply Measured found that 99 percent of brands surveyed1 were on Twitter, while another 30 percent had a specifically dedicated customer service account, Social Media Examiner said, citing Simply Measured statistics. It's becoming increasingly evident that customer service and social media can go hand in hand.\nWith that in mind, here are three principles to consider about social media customer service:\n1. Different channel, same service: Just because there's a more relaxed aura surrounding online network users doesn't mean companies should sacrifice the service provided via social media. While the interaction can be more lighthearted, the end goal is to directly address any question, comment or concern that a consumer may have. Depending on the severity of the issue, a brand may want to just be straightforward and communicate in a professional manner. However, if a customer makes a lighthearted comment, then the company can reciprocate and show their personal side as well. The objective is to create strong relationships in a highly interactive\nchannel.\n2. The quicker the response, the better: The average response time for respondents in the Simply Measured study was five hours, with 10 percent of businesses responding within the hour. Although it's difficult to assemble a qualified team to patrol social media at all hours of the day, a timely response is best practice when it comes to real\u00adtime communication. A Lithium Technologies study found that 53 percent of consumers2 expect a company to respond to their tweet within an hour, and that figure jumps to 72 percent when they have a complaint. If brands neglect to respond, consumers take punishing actions. For example, 60 percent of respondents said they'd be more inclined to express their dissatisfaction publicly.\n3. A social persona should be passive: When it comes to customer response, companies need to be aggressive in finding a solution as quickly as possible. However, the overall personality of a business online should be informative and passive, if anything. There are going to be unpleasant patrons no matter which channel a company explores, but that doesn't give it a free pass to negatively react. An intimidating post or poor reaction often leads to the wrong kind of publicity. Engaging in an argument with a customer or another business online will always be a losing proposition.\nSOURCES\n1 \u00a0http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/exceptional-customer-service-on-twitter/\n2 \u00a0http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2013/consumers-will-punish-brands-that-fail-to-respond-on-twitter-quickly\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Utilities Need an Expert in PCI Compliance", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/do-you-know-where-your-customers-data-is-utilities-need-an-expert-in-pci-compliance\nDo You Know Where Your Customers' Data Is? Utilities Need an Expert in PCI Compliance\nShare this\nSecurity sure isn\u2019t what it used to be! If the recent data breaches of high profile and sophisticated companies in the healthcare, retail and finance industries have taught us anything, it\u2019s that businesses need to seriously assess their data\nsecurity. Now more than ever, utility companies are high profile targets of attempted data theft, with hackers taking advantage of lax security standards.\nPhysical and operational data security should be a top priority for your utility company, particularly when selecting an outsourcing partner. Developing strategies that protect your customers\u2019 data is an essential component of providing top-notch\ncustomer service. But to provide your customers with the highest levels of service and security, it\u2019s important that you look for a partner who can go beyond simply protecting credit card and payment data to also identifying systems that can\nbe used to breach multi-factor authentication techniques.\nWhen selecting an outsourcing partner, here are three considerations your utility company should keep in mind:\nIs your outsourcing partner certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant?Whether your utility company is PCI compliant (but prefers to outsource payment arrangements and processing for cost savings or to provide a better customer experience), or you are not PCI compliant in-house, it\u2019s critically important that\nyour outsourcing partner is certified PCI compliant.\nThere are, however, varying levels of PCI compliance. Many companies claiming to be PCI compliant have not achieved these higher levels of certification, but rather, tout \u201cself-assessment\u201d\u2014which essentially means that they may not have\nbeen independently assessed, nor approved, by leading credit card providers.\nBe sure to ask the following questions to understand the level of PCI compliance a potential outsourcing partner can offer:\nIs the outsourcing partner PCI compliant?If yes, has their compliance been certified by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), or are they self-assessed?Is the Supplier listed on the VISA and MasterCard registered Supplier list?Being certified by a QSA shows an additional investment in the compliance process and likely investment in infrastructure to keep your data safe. To find outsourcing partners certified by a QSA, visit the\u00a0PCI Security Standard\u2019s website1\u00a0and view their list of certified companies.\nCan your outsourcing partner safeguard non-payment data?In 2013,\u00a045 percent of data thefts2\u00a0involved non-payment card\ndata. Protecting your customers\u2019 payment data is vitally important, but focusing only on securing the payment data can leave your customers\u2019 other personal data vulnerable.\nRemember\u2014it\u2019s not just payment data at risk, so it\u2019s important to ask your outsourcing partner whether they are safeguarding data throughout the customer journey or only during payment processes. Particularly in a regulated industry\nlike utilities, customers expect that their data is private and secure. They expect data like their account number, phone number, address and social security number to be as safe as their credit card number.\nIf non-payment data is breached, it could potentially harm your brand. In 2012, nearly 2 million customers of two\u00a0New York-based utility companies3\u00a0had\npersonal data such as their social security numbers, birthdates and other account information exposed. Since then, the threat of a data breach has only grown. To ensure the security of all data\u2014payment and non-payment\u2014ask your outsourcing\npartner whether they meet security expectations in every interaction and for every type of data collected.\nDoes your outsourcing partner provide an exceptional experience throughout the customer journey?You may be selecting an outsourcing partner based on their ability to provide high levels of PCI compliance and security measures, but it\u2019s also important to consider how a third party company interacts with your customers. \u00a0 Consider questions\nlike these:\nDo your customers have the same experience with your payment processing partner as they do with your own representatives?How much control do you have over these interactions?Is your partner committed to providing an\u00a0exceptional customer experience4\u00a0every time?Is your partner actively working to build your brand and enhance NPS\u00ae and customer satisfaction outcomes?Now that customers can easily switch their utility providers, it\u2019s more important than ever to take into consideration the entire customer journey and their interactions with front line representatives. A study published in the\u00a0Harvard Business Review5\u00a0last year showed that less than half (43%) of utilities customers who have a negative experience are still members after a year, compared to 74% who have positive\nexperiences. You need to be certain you\u2019re not losing customers because of poor customer interactions with your outsourcing partner!\nSelecting the right outsourcing partner is about more than payment processing. It\u2019s about securing your customer\u2019s data\u2014all of it\u2014and ensuring that every interaction with your customers is exceptional. If you keep all this in mind\nwhen choosing your partner, you\u2019ll likely succeed at finding a partnership that\u2019s truly win-win.\nSOURCES\n1 \u00a0https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php\n2 \u00a0http://www.forbes.com/sites/frontline/2014/07/07/payment-card-data-isnt-the-only-lucrative-loot-in-a-data-breach/\n3 \u00a0http://www3.dps.ny.gov/pscweb/WebFileRoom.nsf/Web/1986D5ECA1917A8A8525798E005F81DD/$File/pr12007.pdf?OpenElement\n4 \u00a0https://alorica.com/outcomes/actionable-insights/alorica-analytics/ 5 \u00a0https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified/\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc341", "title": "What Makes a Company a Great Place to Work?", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/what-makes-a-company-a-great-place-to-work\nWhat Makes a Company a Great Place to Work?\nAuthored By: Asma Sultana\nShare this\nThe company you work for matters; oftentimes we spend more time working with our colleagues than even seeing our friends and family. As I reflect on my last 20+ years working as a global Talent Acquisition leader, I've come to realize that the concept of an ideal workplace varies greatly from person to person. It hinges on factors like our personal goals, age, interests, location, financial situation and more. Job seekers\u2019 preferences can shift daily, but there's one constant thread that unites us. Regardless of our job title or experience level, we all seek out companies that foster a culture of support, growth and inclusion.While there's no one-size-fits-all way to tell if a company prioritizes its employees, there are a few qualities that all the best companies embody.A Diverse Workforce Any company can say DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) is important to them, but you want to look for employers that can give concrete examples of their commitment. Do they have diverse representation across their workforce? What about within their leadership team? There are many benefits to a strong DEI-focused culture; it allows employees to feel comfortable being themselves and confident to do their best work. According to the McKinsey report Delivering through Diversity, diverse companies attract top talent and have better financial performance. At Alorica, a global CX provider, diversity is in our roots. We are the largest certified minority-owned BPO and as an example, 60% of our workforce is made up of women. In fact, we won an award for our Achievement in Promoting and Developing Women.\u00a0 We are also proud to be awarded as a Top Place to Work by Ragan Awards for our DEI initiatives. Healthy Work-Life BalanceWhen you're considering potential employers, work-life balance should be non-negotiable. Achieving a healthy balance between your personal and professional life has a significant impact on your mental and physical well-being. Research from Frontiers Media has shown that when there's a conflict between work and life, it can lead to lower productivity and performance, potentially holding back your career. At Alorica, we offer a standard five-day work week and organize free health talk sessions as well as health checkup camps. Through our TIDE (Together for Inclusion Diversity and Equity) program, we create a safe and welcoming space for employees to openly and respectfully discuss social issues we face in our communities. Opportunities for Learning and Growth There is nothing quite like a workplace that values your growth and development. Whether it is through training programs, new projects or helping another team, finding a company that believes in your potential and is ready to invest in it is key. It opens limitless possibilities in your career, making you more adaptable and versatile. As leaders, we can kickstart this process for future leaders. I take pride in being part of a company that invests in its employees at all levels, whether they are just starting or seasoned leaders. We get the chance to learn new skills through training programs led by experts from around the globe, which makes us more capable of tackling fresh challenges. Over 80% of our management roles last year were filled from internal promotions. That is the result of working for a company that cares about its people and their career journey.So now you know what to look for, but how do you know what a company\u2019s work culture is really like? You can:Dive into their website to see if their values, mission and activities resonate with you. Ask yourself, \u2018is this a company (or leader) I\u2019d be proud to work for?Don\u2019t shy away from asking questions during the interview that help YOU decide if you want the job. We love candidates who are clear about their expectations and eager to learn more about our company.Go check out the work environment. Can you imagine working there?

Over 4.74B people use social media platforms\u2014including\nover 75% of the global population aged 13 and up\u2014resulting in a worldwide daily average use of nearly 2.5 hours1.\nAnd with so many people online, creating safe spaces to transact and interact is becoming more challenging than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0A Seismic Shift Meets a Clear and Present Danger\u00a0The world is online, using social media to share opinions and argue talking points in numbers never seen before; in the U.S. alone, a staggering 84% of 18-29 year olds are active social media users, with numbers only falling slightly to 81% for 30-49\nyear olds2.\u00a0Unfortunately, explicit content, misleading information, deepfake videos, and conspiracy theories are skyrocketing alongside an explosion in platform use. Such material erodes trust and confidence in our country\u2019s (and indeed the world\u2019s)\nmost critical institutions\u2014and puts individuals, brands and even established traditions at risk. \u202f\u00a0So, what do you do to counter a growing digital threat?\u00a0You deploy a combination of leading-edge technology and human oversight\u2014and you select a partner who understands how to get the job done.\u202f\u202f\u00a0Five Keys to Consider\u00a0Deploying successful content moderation is no small task\u2014and it\u2019s critical to get it right before bad actors can impact your brand reputation.\u00a0\u00a0Here are five factors to keep in mind when selecting a partner: \u202f\u00a0Speed to Scale: Find a partner who can easily support your needs\u2014especially when they\u2019re urgently needed. Your ideal partner should be able to support rapid ramps worldwide, handle high volumes of published content, and have\na legacy of ramping programs swiftly and successfully.\u00a0\u00a0Trust & Safety Expertise: Experience matters\u2014especially with content moderation. And that takes a combination of top-tier talent plus safety protocols and regulatory know-how to keep both clients and frontline moderators secure;\nthe best partners have both.\nPerformance: A great partner has a proven track record plus a platform that harnesses automation technology, AI, and deep analytics to make easy work of moderating multi-media content.\nTalent & Training: Top-tier talent doesn\u2019t just happen\u2026a trust-worthy partner hires, trains, coaches, and fortifies their frontline content moderators, ensuring consistency and scalability in any region. A solid partner\ncontinually optimizes the capabilities of its workforce to consistently deliver through ongoing training, from expanding existing skillsets to keeping up with policy changes.\nWellness: Best-practice based wellness policies are essential for content moderation success\u2014partners should care for their people by offering global wellness and resiliency programs led by licensed mental health practitioners. Daily\nmonitoring of employee wellness, mood, and satisfaction also helps ensure that your first line of defense is always up for the task.\u00a0We\u2019re In This Together\u00a0While the world is more connected than ever, our interlocked societies struggle with bad actors who sully digital platforms with vitriol, manipulation, and lies. Major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have recently stepped-up activities\nto curtail the spread of misleading information, but free-speech arguments are quick to emerge\u2014and the moderation landscape is evolving daily. \u202f\u00a0Like it or not,\u202fsocial media\u202fhas become\u202fthe media\u2014and though journalists possess credentials and routinely fact-check their work product, everyday citizens do not. So, it\u2019s imperative that we prioritize moderation efforts\nand empower our people to safeguard online interests. \u202f\u00a0At the end of the day, the content is here\u2014and moderation is there to meet it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Are you ready?To learn more visit our  Content Moderation page to see how Alorica can help you create Trust & Safety centers of excellence within your business.\u00a01 Hootsuite. 2\u00a0Oberlo.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

You\u2019ll Need a Strategic Framework First", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/getting-into-contact-center-automation-youll-need-a-strategic-framework-first\nGetting Into Contact Center Automation? You\u2019ll Need a Strategic Framework First\nShare this\nDeciding to make the move to automation is one thing. Knowing where to start is another. No doubt you\u2019ve done your homework\u2014read the latest blogs and eBooks like\u00a05 Ways to Drive Calls Out of Your Call Center\u2014 yet you still can\u2019t quite figure out how to get started.\nThat\u2019s why you need to build a strategic framework for self-service.\u00a0 Remember, automation does not replace a human connection. It augments it. By following a guided approach for building a strategic framework, you\u2019ll be able to distinguish\nthe simple from complex and work out what exactly makes the most sense to automate. Creating your framework is as simple as two steps.\nStep 1: Dial in on DemographicsConsider the demographic of your caller\u2014and your industry. A West Interactive Services CX Marks the Spot study found that customers\u2019 likelihood to embrace a shift to self-service depends on the service provided.1\nTake the Government Services/Healthcare sector, for example. While there is a larger appetite for interactive channels including online chat, self-help, etc., fewer customers are open to a mobile platform or social media forum. By contrast, in the Automotive\nsector, the appetite for a mobile solution is much greater, with fewer customers seeking agent-assisted channels.\nWhen it comes to age, non-Millennials (ages 35+) are 5 to 7 percent more likely to seek a traditional service channel\u2014phone, email, in-person, chat or self-help\u2013whereas a Millennial is 5 to 6 percent more likely to use a mobile or social media\nplatform for customer service. Knowing your audience is step one to establishing the roadmap for self-service automation.\nLaunch your self-service engagement strategy early on, leveraging your customers\u2019 profiles. Let this drive your decisions regarding how, when and where to market and engage customers on the available self-service channel options. After all, you\nwant to bring the greatest value\u2013targeting the right interaction solution for the right customer.\nStep 2: Revisit Customer DataTake a look at what you already know about your customers and their habits. Investigate who is repeatedly calling and why. Is the solution they seek available in a self-service channel? For example \u2013 are they calling for password resets, package\ntracking, balance checking or updating personal account details? If the task generated by the customer inquiry requires a relatively low level of abstract thinking or autonomous problem solving, then it is more suitable for automation.\nThen, analyze how many callers are currently using self-service channels and when. Are the self-service solutions robust enough? Are they geared toward the right transaction or customer base? Is there a defect in the process resulting in a false sense\nof resolution?\nWhile originally designed for repeat contact reduction, the same steps work for all contacts. Identify contact reasons, develop solutions, check in to see that the plan is working and act to achieve lasting results. You now have a repeatable practice\nto take you through the customer lifecycle and remove waste from the customer experience.\nDrawing conclusions from the data you already have positions you for a meaningful conversation about where to go with the automation of your business processes.\nStill need help?

Alorica was called upon to create a flexible, burstable\nstaffing model to ensure that they were always meeting their customer\u2019s needs, as well as providing information on new customer opportunities.\nTHE PROGRAM\nThe client was receiving a high amount of calls during their annual enrollment cycles. Unlike traditional mail services, the client\u2019s customers required agents to be able to answer inquiries regarding high-end medications, while also providing those\ncustomers new services for consideration. Consequently, the program needed agents trained in both inbound customer care and sales.\nAs they say in Gotham, when the Commissioner calls, you pick up. And we do.\nTHE SOLUTION\nAlorica designed a customer care and sales solution with the ability to meet the client\u2019s significant annual staffing fluctuations by doubling our workforce and adding several contact centers.\nThat\u2019s right. We doubled our workforce. That\u2019s just the kind of thing we do for our clients. But we digress.\nWe deployed lead scoring and list segmentation to target higher propensity-to-contact members, ultimately reducing the client\u2019s overall cost per prescription. Furthermore, we implemented a proactive outreach for members impacted by plan design limitations,\nand created welcome calls as part of a member\u2019s engagement strategy. To do so, we analyzed landline leads, conducted profiling analytics and incorporated analytic customer heat maps in order to determine the best time of day and day of week\nin which to contact them. Finally, we identified members least likely to contact the client and proactively used alternative, low-cost channels to contact those members case-by-case.\nTHE RESULTS\nTop performer for increasing prescription conversions, per contact, by 10-15%\nConsistently a top performer among all of the client\u2019s internal contact centers\nSince implementing Alorica\u2019s custom program, the client has experienced a 6% increase on member scores and a 19% increase on provider scores\nClick above to download the full case study.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Signs and Solutions to Prevent Call Center Burnout\nShare this\nThe burnout syndrome is an epidemic. In fact, a study from Stanford University reported in the U.S. the cost for healthcare in support of burnout is about $190 billion with 120,000 deaths annually (Gallup Inc., 2017). Additionally, a recent survey found\nthat employee burnout is sabotaging workforce retention. Some of the top reasons mentioned in the study include unfair compensation (41%), unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime or after hours (32%). These facts are not portraying a pretty\npicture for the men and women in our organizations. It\u2019s clear that more and more people are getting burnout in the workplace and it\u2019s our job to try to understand it and find productive ways to reduce this syndrome (Wilkie, 2017).\nContact centers have become a vital part of global businesses. Companies in various industries have contact centers that employ millions of agents to serve as the primary customer-facing channel. According to the United States Department of Labor, customer\nservice representatives (CSR), or customer service agents, employment was projected to grow about 9.8% from 2014 to 2024. The national workforce is projected to only grow to 6.5%. As a comparison, we can see that CSR employment is growing faster than\nthe national workforce average. To effect lasting systemic change, it is critical to understand the factors leading to job burnout for millions of CSR employees around the world (Vizueta, 2014).\nWhat Exactly is Employee Burnout?The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelms contact center employees, leaving 52% of customer service agents feeling that their company isn\u2019t doing enough to prevent burnout (Calabrio). Burnout has been defined as\n\u201ca syndrome of emotional exhaustion and cynicism that occurs frequently among individuals who do \u2018people work\u2019 of some kind\u201d (Jackson, 1981).\nIn the contact center world, burnout is one of the main reasons for turnover. The volume of daily work and the number of customer interactions overwhelm employees. According to a Toister study (Toister, 2016), agents want to deliver excellent\nservice in general. Burnout increases when agents believe their contact center is making it hard for them to accomplish this goal; however, their burnout risk decreases when agents feel their employer is supportive to their needs and its customers.\nAgents want to feel empowered to provide exceptional service.\nWhat Are Those Burnout Symptoms?Being a customer engagement expert is a high-pressure job. When facing multiple customers with numerous requests daily, with the expectation to create empathy, rapport and even trust, one can become very detached from their work. It\u2019s an uphill\nbattle to continually display positive emotions and to suppress negative ones in a complex contact center environment. Here are the top three burnout symptoms that normally appear in the workplace within the first year of employment (Jackson, 1981):\nIncreased Emotional Exhaustion: Agents feel that as their emotional resources are drained, they are no longer able to cope with issues on a psychological level.Cynicism Towards Customers: Agents are prone to negative and cynical attitudes towards customers. Maslach and Jackson concluded that the adverse reactions to a customer could be linked to the experience of emotional exhaustion.Professional Efficacy: \u201cThe tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly regarding one\u2019s work with customers.\u201d In other words, when employees feel dissatisfied with their performance, the consequences can\nbe quite severe and detrimental to employees, their customers, and ultimately to the organization.\u00a0Solutions to Prevent Agent BurnoutIn my experience, burnout symptoms occur in organizations where employees feel undervalued and overworked. Trust is a significant component when it comes to understanding the key factors leading to emotional exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy.\nTo prevent or minimize burnout in contact centers an organization must:\n1. Avoid Favoritism: Treat people with respect and treat people fairly, without favoritism. The slightest perception of a manager favoring one person or group against another, will cause resentment and trust will not be achieved.2. Have Clear Values: Make sure that operational processes and the company\u2019s mission and vision statements are clear to all employees. When employees perceive a value conflict on the job, their engagement with work tends to decrease.3. Minimize Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity: Establish continued training around employee roles and processes. Employees should be encouraged to participate in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and ambiguity in the contact\ncenter environment.4. Understand the Contact Center Environment: Training or seminars can enhance the employee\u2019s capacity to cope with their workplace. The organization should not focus on changing the individual alone; instead, the organization\nshould start implementing some of these incremental changes within itself.Burnout is commonplace, and no one is immune to it. It\u2019s important to structure your work environment so that every manager and employee feels motivated and has the tools and support they need to succeed. At Alorica, we\u2019re focused\non creating insanely great customer interactions. It starts with providing a healthy work environment for our people, filled with a culture rooted in fun, encouragement and collaboration.

{"_id": "doc360", "title": "Future of Trust and Safety Blog", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/future-of-trust-and-safety-blog\nFuture of Trust and Safety Blog\nShare this\nThe Trust & Safety Professional Organization (TSPA) is a global community of Trust & Safety professionals who develop and enforce principles, policies, and practices to create online standards of behavior and content facilitated by digital technologies. The association is overseen by venerated tech pioneers, legal experts, and professors, including former COOs of Mozilla and Heads of Policy from Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter. TPSA offers a comprehensive overview into Trust & Safety, both as an industry and as a practice, including The Future of Trust & Safety, a review of new challenges presented by the continued evolution of technology and the pervasive nature of threats online. In the market overview, the TSPA defines several key areas of focus; as a leading Trust & Safety provider for ~15 years, our perspective offers a seasoned view on these trends. \u00a0Increased investments to keep users safeAs detailed by the TPSA, companies have been investing more in Trust & Safety, particularly over the past decade. Industries from nearly every niche are prioritizing online safety, from beefing up security to harnessing AI/NLP technology to streamline multi-media moderation efforts. For online platforms and eCommerce websites, keeping users safe is a top priority\u2014safeguarding against bad actors, fraud, and malicious content is essential to bottom lines\u2014requiring constant oversight and action in an ever-changing landscape.Keeping ahead of the curve is essential for successful content moderation, as well as anticipating client needs. Investing heavily in leading-edge technology and top-tier talent, partnering with third-party technology developers, and working with diverse, global Trust & Safety teams gives companies an advantage against online threats. And we couldn\u2019t agree more; our many investments include implementing proprietary and third-party tools to streamline multilingual, multi-media content moderation, speed up collaboration and information flow, and enhance training, coaching, and retention. \u00a0But, in our experience, we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s just as important to take care of your frontline content moderators, those intrepid individuals staring down online threats day after day. Caring for our people is a bedrock principle at Alorica; digital, gamified apps and to assess engagement and mood, ongoing wellness coaching and training, as well as anytime access to licensed mental health professionals, keep our content moderators going strong. \u00a0Proactive and protective effortsAs bad actors and cybercriminals become increasingly sophisticated, cybersecurity strategies continually evolve to meet new threats. A highlight of the TPSA report is the importance of keeping customers and clients safe online; this requires a deep understanding of the different ways users can be harmed, as well as how they act with online platforms.\u00a0 Successful Trust & Safety efforts adapt to policy changes, keeping both clients and content moderators up-to-date about what threats are out there\u2014and what can be done about them. We\u2019ve found deep analytics to be absolutely invaluable for illuminating user behavior, as well as isolating known threats.To best support the needs and requirements of leading global brands, Alorica\u2019s approach relies on a combination of data-driven analytics, a nimble and scalable worldwide workforce, proprietary technology, and training models to ensure content moderation is always accurate, expedient, and based on intent, local context, current events, and community guidelines. \u00a0Keeping in lockstep with new legislation and regulationsWhat\u2019s online has been influencing everything from public policy to fashion trends for over a quarter century, and how people communicate in online spaces has become increasingly important to everyone from governments, corporations, and organizations to individuals. As the TPSA advises, free expression is vital to online communities, but companies and countries often have to grapple with what\u2019s said and spread online without existing guidelines, creating new policies quickly because users expect the platforms they use to be safe and secure at all times. In practice, we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s essential to keep up with corporate policies and regulatory changes, and continually educate all Trust & Safety specialists, including content moderators, as well as proactively prepare for changing requirements. \u00a0Ready to learn more?Visit our\u00a0Content Moderation\u00a0solutions page to see how Alorica can help you create Trust & Safety centers of excellence within your business.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

A Hiring Analytics Case Study\nDownload\nShare this\nThe client\u2014a security software company\u2014required a very specific agent profile to provide world-class technical support to their highly-knowledgeable customer base.\u00a0After a complete assessment, we concluded that our proprietary hiring\nanalytics platform would play a key role in sourcing the right talent for this nearshore operation.\nDownload our We've Got Their Back (Up's)! A Hiring Analytics Case Study\u00a0to learn more.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nLaunch a nearshore operation\u2014close to the client\u2019s home-base, and with agents who possess strong English-speaking skills\nIdentify, train and deploy a team of qualified agents to handle chat and email channels\nDemonstrate success in the first wave, and prepare for a larger deployment\nTHE OUTCOME\nUsing hiring analytics and advanced agent profiling, 100% of chat/email applicants that were hired graduated training and passed rigorous client clearance QA processes with flying colors\nCSAT scores jumped by 73%; performing 10% higher vs. client\u2019s in-house team\nWe anticipate 150% growth with the client\nTHE CHALLENGE\nStarting Small and Thinking Big.\nHandling chat and email channels can be more complicated than voice-based technical support work, so finding a team of qualified agents presented as a unique test. The client discovered this first-hand, as their existing team couldn\u2019t run concurrent\nchats and made missteps\u2014and simply didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to support everything at once. Shortly after launching our program, we successfully migrated the first wave of voice-support agents over to chat and email\u2014and buoyed by\ntheir success, prepared to expand.\nTHE SOLUTION\nMultitasking to the Rescue!\nOur agents in this program are in a totally different kind of position; they not only need to be proficient in tech support but have to be able to toggle between multiple conversations at once. Our proprietary hiring analytics platform played a key role\nin sourcing the right talent; this technology allowed us to construct the ideal agent profile, and we used the platform to screen candidates for their multitasking abilities, ultimately hiring agents best suited for the complex, multi-channel work.\nThe new, Jamaica-based team quickly exceeded expectations in both customer satisfaction (CSAT) and overall Quality Assurance (QA). Coupled with cutting down Average Handle Time (AHT) and the cost savings this nearshore location offered, the client\nwas thrilled\nTHE OUTCOME\nEver-expanding Opportunities.\nThanks to the success of the program, we continue to absorb more volume from the client, and we are currently exploring ways to expand lines of business. We began with just a few agents in this multi-channel support role, and we\u2019re on pace to more\nthan quadruple the number of agents by the end of 2019. We estimate that that once the team is fully up to speed, we\u2019ll average up to two concurrent chats at all times\u2014and we\u2019re pretty darn proud of that\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

UNREAL CIRCUMSTANCES. UNMATCHED RESULTS.\nAlorica has provided work-at-home (WAH) solutions for more than 17 years. So when COVID-19 struck, and a leading telecommunications provider made the decision to shift 100% of their workforce to a virtual model, this wasn\u2019t our first WAH rodeo.\nFar from it. In this instance, we were already overseeing a small but highly-capable work-at-home team for the client. The programs we had established and the practices already implemented would prove enormously valuable, as we worked to migrate the\nclient\u2019s entire program (thousands of agents) to a work-at-home environment\u2014in only a few weeks. The outcome was transformative\u2014and has positioned us for greater flexibility in the future. But we\u2019ll get to all that.\nTHE RESULTS\nAttrition for work-at-home agents was 15% lower than brick-and-mortar (B&M) agents in the same program\nCustomers rated their experiences 7% higher with WAH agents as compared to B&M employees\nAHT was an average 34 points lower for WAH agents than B&M\nContact Resolution was rated 3% higher in WAH agents\nTHE CHALLENGE\nExperience when it mattered most.\nPrior to COVID-19, all agents were required to meet rigorous requirements for the program\u2014including working in a brick-and-mortar setting for at least 90 days and meeting or exceeding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics; this helped ensure that\nagents working at home would be able to handle the rigors of the role and adapt to 100% virtual onboarding, training and production support. When federal and state mandates necessitated a total migration to a work-at-home customer experience outsourcing\nmodel, the client already had a strong blueprint in place. With documented success in the existing WAH agent group, our client was well-positioned when the decision was made to shift all employees to work-at-home. Still, moving that many agents in\nsuch a short timeframe\u2014and against the backdrop of COVID-19\u2014was no small order\nTHE SOLUTION\nBest practices for a best-in-class result.\nTime was of the essence, and we had none to lose. Fortunately, our experienced work-at-home workforce helped the brick-and-mortar team get up and running quickly and efficiently.\nExisting best practices were deployed to the newly-transitioned agents, and as they adjusted to their new at-home environment, we closed the performance gap and established effective routines for both agents and leadership. These routines were grounded\nin a continued commitment to rigorous security and compliance standards, two-way virtual agent communication, collaboration and top-notch leadership support\u2014and were a vital component of previous and ongoing success.\nTHE OUTCOME\nLeveraging the past and looking to the future.\nSeveral months into the new normal, the client\u2019s work-at-home teams consistently outperform their legacy B&M counterparts in key metrics. Today, as regulations slowly allow\nemployees to return on-site, a hub-and-spoke model is being used; agents are acquiring skills in a B&M environment, before \u2018graduating\u2019 to WAH when and if circumstances dictate In fact, our success with the program has earned us a\nbest-in-class reputation\u2014against which now benchmark agent performance.\nIt\u2019s an unpredictable world out there\u2014and preparedness and confidence in a solution goes a long way.\nABOUT ALORICA\nAlorica is a global leader in customer experience solutions.

{"_id": "doc368", "title": "Build a Lean Mean Customer Knowledgebase Machine for Effortless Self-Service", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/build-a-lean-mean-customer-knowledgebase-machine-for-effortless-self-service\nBuild a Lean Mean Customer Knowledgebase Machine for Effortless Self-Service\nShare this\nA streamlined troubleshooting guide can help effectively resolve a customer issue and improve the overall customer experience. Knowledgebase content aids a customer in an online self-service environment or through an interactive voice response system\n(IVR). It\u2019s a critical component of self-service, designed to empower the customer through the resolution process.\nIn a time of information overload, it\u2019s important to keep information accessible, current and accurate. This makes it easier for customers to find resolutions for their problems. According to Salesforce, 75% of consumers say that say it is important\nto be able to interact with a company on their personal schedule.1\nFollow these four steps to ensure the knowledgebase you create for your customers drives resolution and increases overall satisfaction. After all, the best way to gain loyalty from your customers is by making it easy for them to do business with you.\nIdentify Where Your Customers Can Self-Serve\nAs you build your customer knowledgebase, the first step is identifying possible scenarios or problems that are easy to resolve using self-help troubleshooting.\nSome examples include:\nSetting up an account\nResetting a password\nAccessing an account\nReinstating service\nAdding services to the account\nThis is also the time to think about Help Access Points (or HAPs).\u00a0 HAPs help you to identify where the customer is when the need for help arises.\u00a0 Your strategy for how to design and deliver customer facing service content would be impacted\nby the HAPs identified.\u00a0 A key to delivering an effortless experience is serving the right content to the customer at the exact time and place where help is needed.\nA recent study by Groove HD found that 71% of customers who encounter great response times are recommending that specific brand.2\u00a0As you think through potential reasons a customer would need support, keep in mind the customer lifecycle\nof your product or service and identify the possible scenarios from each phase.\nCreate the Self-Service Content\nNow that you\u2019ve compiled the list of potential customer issues, it\u2019s time to roll up your sleeves and create a knowledgebase article explaining the resolution for each of those potential customer issues.\nThe first step is to design your knowledgebase approach. Two popular approaches are a decision tree and a process map.\nA decision tree guides the customer through a step-by-step process and branches out depending on what occurs at each step.\nA process document creates a series of steps and diagrams to aid a customer through resolving an issue.\nWhen you create content outlining the troubleshooting steps, it\u2019s important that you think about how this content will work in a self-service vs. agent-assisted customer support environment. For example, when you are guiding a customer through self-help,\nit\u2019s best to include screen shots and other imagery to allow the customer to read and visualize the steps for resolution.\nIt is important that the content designed is easy to understand and flows smoothly.\u00a0 Resolving a customer\u2019s issue through self-service doesn\u2019t need to be complex.\u00a0 In a recent article, Gartner states that organizations often have\nvery complex content/information architecture and service-case workflows. This makes it difficult for your customers to find relevant information quickly. The rapid creation and retrieval of relevant content and knowledge are key attributes of leading\nenterprises.\n3\nDeveloping content is time consuming and the more you can leverage the content from one article for both self-service and contact center support, the less content management you will need post-deployment.\nUnderstand How Often Your Content is Being Used\nIn any business, measurement is key to understanding where you are doing well and where you have opportunities to drive improvement. The same concept applies to your knowledgebase.\u00a0 To measure the effectiveness of your content, you need to understand\nhow often an article is being used and if the article resolved the customer\u2019s issue.\nIn a self-service environment, you can include a question\u2014Did this information resolve your issue? \u2014after the customer completes the troubleshooting steps.\nIn a contact center environment, the agent can ask the question, or you can collect the data through a follow-up customer satisfaction survey.\nIn addition to understanding whether or not the article resolved the customer\u2019s issue, it\u2019s also important to understand and monitor what key words customers and support representatives use for searches. This insight will help you optimize\nyour search functionality and your content management strategy.\nMaintain Your Self-Service Content\nA knowledgebase is only effective if the content is current and there is a defined process in place to manage updates. If content is not maintained appropriately, it increases the effort required by your customers as they search through large quantities\nof content that may or may not be accurate. This may result negatively on customer satisfaction and prompt an unnecessary increase in call volumes.\nEven further, too much content about the same topic or outdated content that no longer contains accurate steps for resolution can greatly the impact the way your customer views your brand.\u00a0 Oracle has found that 55% of customers commit to a brand\nbecause of the ability to easily find the information or help they need.4\nYou must have the right information available for self-service and the contact center, but content management will ultimately drive your success.\nTo be successful at content management, define a process to update your knowledgebase.\nEstablish a frequency for all articles to be reviewed and updated.\nMaintain an inventory of all articles with publish dates.\nUpdate the key search words based on current content available.\nRemove articles that are outdated or no longer accurate. Make sure that any article rewrites replace the original articles.\nThe support environment is always changing. We know tech savvy customers want the ability to resolve their issue before contacting support. Self-service resources allow your customers to solve their own issues in a way that\u2019s fast and easy. A study\nby Ganter predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer relationships will be managed without the customer ever needing to interact with another person.5\nIn this DIY era, offering self-service is a necessity.

She wanted to work with people because building relationships was her passion. So, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat a job in recruiting was her next step. \u00a0 With a background in temporary staffing, employment management in the hotel industry, and corporate recruiting, her role at Alorica has allowed her to meld her two strengths together: managing teams and matching individuals with the right job opportunities.\nShe has found success by truly believing in what she\u2019s doing and looking at challenges as obstacle courses that you can overcome. Read Karly\u2019s full Q&A below:\nQ: What gets you up in the morning?A: Knowing that I have a direct impact on really pleasing our customers and our clients and growing Alorica. Every day we have hundreds of\nagents starting in our organization. I love doing what I do because I know I am making a difference, and I add the human touch into it. When I am visiting sites and I see the family feel and see people connecting to others, I love knowing that people\nare making long-lasting relationships at work.\nQ: What are the key ways that you approach challenges in your day to day work?A:  I\u2019m a visual type of person. What I tell anybody if they come to me and ask for advice\nis, \u201cokay, list the obstacles, and now let\u2019s talk about how we will go about removing those obstacles.\u201d Then we can follow up and talk about what is still an obstacle. After you\u2019ve gotten through your obstacle course, it\u2019s\nhelpful to go back and, in your mind, list the obstacles you went through and how you overcame them and fixed them.\nQ: How do you view mentorship in the workplace?A:  I advanced in my career because mentors set great examples. In my first job out of college, I absorbed everything like a sponge.\nWhether they knew it or not, there were people who I looked at for inspiration. Their actions helped me learn and grow. Today, I find mentors everywhere--they are the people that leave me thinking after a phone call. They get my mind turning, help\nme understand challenges, and get me thinking about how I can take control of what I can control. \u00a0Q: What motivated you in pursuing this career path?A: I wanted to be on the positive side of a business and to connect with people. In recruiting, you\u2019re always giving\ngood news. \u201cYou got a job! Congratulations!\u201d If I can go to bed at night thinking to myself, \u201cToday, I placed 30 people in positions, I know they\u2019re excited and I\u2019m excited.\u201d That was my drive for choosing my own\njob roles throughout my career. \u00a0Q: Did you have a specific career plan that led to your current role at Alorica?A: For me, it hasn\u2019t necessarily been about making a long-term career plan. An opportunity\ncame up a year ago which allowed me to continue to find jobs for people as a Sr. Director of Talent Acquisition. It helped get me back into managing people, an area in which I am also passionate about. Having been with Alorica for almost six years,\nI love making an impact on the organization in both areas.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Illustrating\nthis point beautifully is this month\u2019s Alorican in Action, VP of Client Solutions, Beverley Bridges. Read Beverley\u2019s Q&A below to explore her unique 13-year career at Alorica (and counting), and advice for succeeding on your own path.\nQ: Did you have a plan to reach an executive-level position?A: I\u2019d like to say that I strategically orchestrated my career every step of the way, but that would be a lie.\nBeing successful has meant always doing my best, recognizing that I am responsible for the choices that I make, and treating people how I want them to treat me. I believe that diversity is what makes us great, so I like to bring my perspective to\nsituations and encourage others to do so as well.\nQ: Did you ever work with a mentor, and did that process help you?A: I have a lot of mentors\u2014and most of them don\u2019t even know I see them that way! My philosophy\nis that the life you live speaks louder than the words you say. Mentors have been both colleagues and people I know outside of work\u2014almost everyone has taught me something.Q: What advice would you give about climbing the career ladder?A: Know your value. If you don\u2019t know it, nobody else will. Also, lift others as you climb and don\u2019t\ngive up or give in if your career track isn\u2019t going as you imagined\u2014resiliency is a great skill to master. Lastly, don\u2019t burn bridges. You never know when you might want to lean on an old colleague for advice or a fresh point of\nview.\nQ: What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections?A: My grandmother and mother always said, \u201cget in where you fit in.\u201d Through my regular one-on-one meetings\nwith each of my clients, I try to find commonalities; it doesn\u2019t have to be about work, but perhaps family, hobbies, upcoming events or whatever is important to each of us. Connecting with people is how you build trust and respect.\nQ: What excites you most about what you do? A: Taking on new challenges. The hurdles are exciting, and once you get to the other side of it, you can say, \u201cthis is what\nwe did.\u201d What also brings me joy is keeping people motivated. I think it\u2019s very important as women that we know who has our back and is invested in seeing us grow and move upward. Surround yourself with people who share your goals and\nobjectives, and are willing to have courageous conversations with you when you get off track. You may not always like what they have to say, but as women, authentic relationships are critical.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Armed with a master\u2019s degree in philosophy, this Director of Client Solutions uses deep analysis to uncover the root causes of an issue and\nto help guide her to a solution.Pency started out as an agent and has since held positions in quality, training and operations management. She believes change can be scary, but it\u2019s also good. Read her full Q&A below.\nWhat professional advice has helped you in your career? Early on, I was trying to fit into the mold of what I thought a young, strong black woman in corporate America was supposed to be like. I have a really big\npersonality, I\u2019m very opinionated and I can come off a little harsh sometimes, but I was silencing myself. Then Colleen Beers gave me the best advice: she said to \u201cbe Pency.\u201d That really freed me up to come into my own.\nLooking back, do you regret any career moves you did or didn\u2019t make? Once Andy Lee visited our site and asked what we could do to improve, but I didn\u2019t speak up because I didn\u2019t want to come\noff as a know-it-all or be a troublemaker. I wasn\u2019t being Pency! I really regret not using my voice when I had the opportunity, but I don\u2019t hold back anymore.\nHow can we all continue to better ourselves at work? Our success is dependent upon each other, so see what you can do to improve. Take every class and attend every conference that\u2019s offered to you. Last\nyear I attended COPC certification training, and it was my most eye-opening experience ever, both personally and professionally.\nWhat does it take to build lasting relationships with colleagues, clients and other contacts? A lot of people have difficulty delivering bad news, especially to clients, but my main thing is honest communication.\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it, I\u2019ll just say it. And if it can be fixed, they know that I\u2019ll roll up my sleeves and dig in.What is your advice on how to make meaningful connections? Be honest. Let your personality come through, and don\u2019t be afraid to be vulnerable. A meaningful connection comes when you are who you are to someone,\nand they\u2019re who they are to you. It\u2019s the only way.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

To find out, I sought insight from the following nine tech executives .\nWe will see fundamental shifts in how organizations approach B2B marketing. Juliette Rizkallah, Chief Marketing Officer, SailPoint\n\u201cStandard marketing models will begin to emulate more aggressive and digitally focused B2C marketing approaches, where companies leverage a variety of digital touchpoints to target an individual buyer. B2B marketing will need to adjust the B2C approaches\nto handle the multi-personae account buying committee and will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to measure the progression of accounts along the top of the funnel. The second shift will surround events and the role they play in\nthat funnel. Once largely used for high-level awareness, virtual or physical events in 2021 will instead move further down in the funnel and become more targeted to initiate engagement with accounts already active and showing commercial intent.\u201d\nIn terms of digital fluency, marketers are years ahead of where anyone thought we\u2019d be going into 2021. Alicia Tillman, Global Chief Marketing Officer at SAP\n\u201cThe technology, the tactics, the flexible mindset \u2013 with these tools, disruption is no longer the showstopper it once was. As the world moves forward day by day, marketers are more prepared than ever to be agile and deliver the experiences\naudiences need, when they need them. Rather than months-long marketing campaigns, brand marketing will more closely mirror the way we\u2019re living our lives as individuals. In the moment, deeply empathetic, and tuned into each other\u2019s needs.\u201d\nWe will see a stark divide in an organization\u2019s marketing budget spend, followed by consequential impact. Jim Kruger, Chief Marketing Officer, Veeam\n\u201cWith the unstable economy projected to carry into the new year, there will be a resulting stark divide in marketing budget spend. On one end, companies will look to cut back on marketing budgets because they see it as a variable cost that can be\nmanaged up or down fairly easily. On the other end, companies will increase investment in marketing because they see driving demand and building the brand as top priorities. Looking ahead, those organizations pivoting funds away from marketing will\nultimately endure longer term impacts. Marketing takes quite some time to build on, and by toggling budgets up and down, past investments will begin to lose momentum. A dip in marketing spend will put these companies well behind others who continue\nto invest. Those who choose to navigate through this uncertainty and prepare for recovery will be far more successful in the long run.\u201d\nVerifying human engagement will be critical for marketer leaders. Dan Lowden, Chief Marketing Officer, White Ops\n\u201cIn 2021, marketing leaders will be able to confidently verify engagement with real humans as they increasingly become more aware of how sophisticated bots and fraud are infiltrating their marketing spend. Marketers will partner with specialists\nthat can help them accurately gauge if their campaigns are targeting real humans \u2013 resulting in better customer experience, ensuring higher engagement, bringing visibility to cleaner data, improving the company's compliance position and driving\nstronger ROI across marketing campaigns. Marketers will be given a more critical seat at the executive table because of these insights and actions that help grow the business while ensuring every marketing dollar is effectively spent.\u201d\nRecent privacy regulations have given license for walled gardens to raise their walls even higher.Abhay Singhal, CEO, InMobi Marketing Cloud\n\u201cThis is an extremely uncertain period of time, and CMOs shouldn\u2019t have one roadmap \u2013 they should have multiple. For starters, marketing teams will need to be prepared to make the case for why consumers should opt in to data sharing\nwithin the app. On the flip side, marketers should also be prepared to potentially not have access to that data and will need to find alternative solutions or tactics to create as much of a consistent ID as possible. Without this, advertisers are\nat risk of presenting the same ads to consumers over and over, which compromises brand image and user experience. Having contingency plans for both scenarios will be critical, and marketers need to start setting expectations and redefining metrics\nas soon as possible.\u201d\nCompany culture will play an even bigger role in recruiting great marketing talent. Amanda Bohne, Chief Marketing Officer at AppNeta\n\u201cNow that so many companies have proven that, for many, remote work can be as effective as in-office work, it will be hard for businesses to return to the old ways of doing things if they want to continue to recruit top talent. Top marketers will\nnow be sought after by companies located across the country, enabling them to potentially live somewhere different or more affordable than where their current employer is located. Trying to recruit for a company where in-office work is mandated will\nstart to meaningfully impact your candidate pool, and therefore your ability to attract the best talent.\u201d\nNo matter what product you sell, what you need to market is trust. Dale Renner CEO, Co-Founder, RedPoint Global\n\u201cConsumers want trust in the product quality, trust in the organization handling your data, trust that the organization is doing what is right for the environment and social needs, trust that the organization knows and values you. Trust is ultimately\ndriven through a series of interactions \u2013 those brands that are responsible with a consumer\u2019s data and use it to create value for the consumer, those that provide consistent experiences, those that operate at the consumer\u2019s cadence\nwill build that trust. Brands unable to be trustworthy, will experience a dramatic decline in customer loyalty and brand value.\u202f\u201d\nB2B marketers will primarily focus on strengthening relationships with existing customers. Elena Filimonova, SVP, Marketing CGS\n\u201cMarketers will evaluate their customer base to provide them with unused benefits of their service, while building out business opportunities for the future. By sharing best practices and tips for leveraging existing services with valued customers,\nMarketers will ensure long-term loyalty with their companies as these customers may be struggling in the current environment.\u201d\nGoogle and Apple have led the industry-wide clapback for transparency and data privacy. Susan Lee, Chief Product Officer, Valassis\n\u201cIn the new year, it\u2019s reasonable to assume other tech companies will put similar measures in place to further reduce user signals. Fewer precise data points from cookies and mobile device IDs means marketers will engage fewer consumers on\na one-to-one or known basis. Instead, marketing teams will need to leverage advanced machine learning models and other probabilistic techniques to reach high-value audiences who look like your known customer base, maximizing scale.\u201d\nOmnipresent CX will be a game changer in defining brand loyalty. Colson Hillier, Chief Marketing Officer, Alorica Inc.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s 'continuously-connected' way of life, it\u2019s not enough that brands respond to customers through multiple channels. Consumers crave effortless CX\u2014being able to alternate quickly from different platforms, but for these channels to also be personalized, persistent and effective in solving pain points in the user experience. In 2021, you\u2019ll\nsee more companies stay one step (or maybe even five!) ahead of customers\u2019 wants through advanced analytics and embedded intelligence, which in turn creates more contextual and meaningful interactions that allow brands to market, sell and serve\ntheir customers better and faster. When brands proactively \u2018push\u2019 tailored experiences rather than rely on customers to \u2018pull\u2019 from services after they\u2019ve had a problem, that changes the nature of the relationship, offering\ninsights for marketing teams to better evaluate evolving consumer preferences. The convergence of always-connected consumers, new platforms for service delivery and permissioned data provides the insights, context and channels that ultimately redefine\nbrand loyalty.\u201d\nThe article was originally published on Forbes.com at http://bit.ly/38xESeW\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc386", "title": "Designing a Survey Strategy? 6 Tips for Success.", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/designing-a-survey-strategy-6-tips-for-success\nDesigning a Survey Strategy? 6 Tips for Success.\nShare this\nA common topic of conversation in the customer experience world is the ideal customer satisfaction survey. How many questions should it include? What are the right channels? How do you increase survey return rates?\nWhile these questions make sense, are they the right questions to ask? Rather than trying to find the perfect survey (minimal questions with insightful answers, and a high rate of return), companies should consider asking a different question\u2014is\nthe current method for delivering surveys generating the data needed to improve the business, as well as the overall customer experience?\nA better use of time and resources is to reevaluate the strategy used to gather sentiment. Use these 6 tips as a starting point to help ensure that you continually receive useful data from the consumers that best represent your customer base.\n1. Ask the right people.\nThe people answering your surveys are likely not the best representatives of your customer base. According to Gartner, the customers willing to complete a survey fall into the extremes of very happy and very upset. This creates a data set that\nomits the thoughts and opinions of the average customer and leads to decisions that are not tailored to the majority of the company\u2019s customers.1\nTo gather opinions from customers that will provide the useful insight businesses\ncrave, it is essential to ask for feedback in channels where the majority of your customers operate, which leads to our next point.\n2. Keep customers from saying, \u2018No way, survey!\u2019\nSurveys with too many questions or poorly constructed answer options will likely result in your user quitting the survey part way through, and they will be less inclined to answer future surveys.2\nBusinesses who are focusing on\nhow to best gather the sentiment of their consumer base need to understand the ways that they like to communicate, and tailor the channels utilized accordingly.\n3. Ask the right questions.\nSeveral companies fall into the trap of asking the standard experience/agent satisfaction questions. These general questions don\u2019t always provide insightful feedback that can be used to improve a business.\nSurvey Monkey suggests that\ncompanies define clear and attainable goals. Identifying what success looks like for your organization\u2014and making sure that you are asking the questions that provide you with insights\u2014is what will help you reach your goals.3\u00a0Think\nabout what you are trying to accomplish. Are you hoping to gain insight into how to improve agent performance, customer loyalty to your brand, or both? Answer these questions, and you will know the questions to ask.\n4. Keep the survey relevant.\nGainsight Go indicates that sending a survey devoid of personality and lacking any incentive are two major factors in whether a customer even decides to complete it. The decision to engage depends on how the request arrives. 4\nTraditional channels can be altered in ways to keep them relevant and convenient. An option to drive survey engagement is proximity marketing technology. In a consumer study by beacon platform Swirl,*\u00a0over 70% of shoppers who received beacon-triggered content and offers said it made them more likely to make a purchase during a store visit.5\nDon\u2019t be afraid to be bold when considering options!\n5. Show the value.\nCustomers are more likely to tell you what they think if they have seen the impact of past feedback on a product or experience. Don\u2019t just ask questions if the answers will disappear into a black hole. Show customers a direct correlation\nbetween feedback and improved service. This can come in the form of one-to-one feedback (i.e. a supervisor reaching out to an unsatisfied customer to rectify the situation) but can also be done effectively by trumpeting improvements made to products/services\nbased on direct customer feedback.\n6. Use the data available to you.\nMost businesses already have a considerable amount of customer interaction data that they can use to understand sentiment. This data will likely provide more true insight than any survey could. Text and voice analytics solutions can be used to\nanalyze interaction transcripts, providing companies with valuable insight into how their customers view several different aspects of their business\u2014products, support service options and agent interactions to name a few.\nThis list doesn\u2019t\ncover everything to consider for your customer feedback gathering strategy, but it is a starting point.

In retail, an omnichannel contact strategy provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether they\u2019re shopping online\nfrom a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a brick-and-mortar store.1\nIn the contact center industry, omnichannel represents a unified experience from one support channel to the next. Before reaching out to customer service, 66% of consumers explore prices online before heading to the store.2\u00a0By the time\nthey connect with a contact center, customers expect the care representative to understand what steps they have already taken. They also expect human ability to solve their challenges better than a machine or online community; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t\nbe calling to begin with.\nConsider your smartphone. It remembers previous searches and builds a profile for you, pushing relevant content based on your history. Customers expect the same sort of history to be available when reaching out to their favorite brands. They want to be\nrecognized, not caught in the cycle of repeating themselves only to learn that their customer service agent either cannot solve the issue better than the app could, or worse, doesn\u2019t possess the baseline capabilities the app does. It\u2019s\ncrucial to have a solution that brings it all together in a meaningful way that doesn\u2019t add significant length to the interaction.\nMany companies are making heavy investments in customer-facing digital technology, but oftentimes, integration with the contact center software is overlooked, resulting in a multichannel solution that doesn\u2019t allow for the continuous experience\nof true omnichannel excellence. In many cases, multiple systems are still required to achieve one result. Without proper redesign and integration, what\u2019s left is a solution that causes more harm than good, leaving the burden on the contact center\nagent to resolve a complicated case.\nAs you create a list of what is important to you in an omnichannel tool, look at your existing infrastructure to determine if you\u2019re ready for the leap. Ask yourself the following three questions to best position yourself for success.\n1. System consolidation:\nHow many front-end and back-end systems are contact center agents currently using to research customer accounts and case history?\nIf the answer is more than one, it\u2019s a good idea to consolidate the existing systems prior to integrating with digital technology. Multiple systems lead to increased customer effort and longer resolution times. Remember, the more history the front\nline is armed with, the more intuitive and streamlined a CRM system should be for an exceptional customer experience.\n2. Multichannel platform integration:\nDoes your CRM platform interface well with web-based technology, and are you capturing the customer touchpoints at the self-service stage?\nIf the answer is no, either prioritize a facelift of the existing system or consider using a system integrator to bring the various channels together. When customers begin interacting via app, web, social media, and AI, the details of these touches must\npush to the front line for a cohesive experience and customer response. With important customer journey details in one platform, you can arm your care team with the necessary history for a truly robust and empowered customer experience.\n3. Employee experience considerations:\nNow that your most basic contacts are handled automatically, what is your strategy and budget for enhancing the more complex task skills of your front-line agents?\nAs employee expectations become more complex, training investments will be critical to ongoing success. Consider what concepts, such as routine system changes, can be easily adopted through online content delivery. While even the best Learning Management\nSystem will not replace the need for facilitator-led content, moving simple content to employee self-service can certainly augment the facilitator efforts. This leaves time and space for more in-depth strategy and procedural changes to be delivered\nlive in a classroom environment.\nAs you pave the way for front-line employees to take on additional responsibilities, make sure your compensation and efficiency expectations align with the skill set required. The new call types will require additional expertise and research time,\nespecially tasks previously handled by a Tier 2 agent. As skill requirements gain complexity, you will invest in agents\u2019 knowledge and adjust compensation to align accordingly with the heightened expectations and to prevent employee pool\nburnout. This will also ensure you are attracting the right level of talent for the job. With self-service channels resulting in reduced contact volume, the funding to provide necessary compensation adjustments should be readily available.\nWith awareness and attention to these crucial details for a seamless integration, you can confidently forge onward in your quest for automation. Developing a framework to address these three critical areas will help you avoid common pitfalls, leading\nto true omnichannel leadership. \u00a0 Interested in learning more?

And while for some industries, like retail, that\u2019s innately part of every brand\u2019s identity; for others, like the banking, financial services, and insurance sector (BFSI), giving customers\nthe digital experiences they want isn\u2019t so simple. Here are some of BFSI\u2019s challenges and the best ways to solve for them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make It Personal\u00a0\u00a0Consumers, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, have grown accustomed to personalized services and access through a variety of different channels, elevating expectations for BFSI companies exponentially. Customers want to feel like their financial\ninstitutions know them\u2014especially since they have access to some of their most sensitive information. For many large institutions, the servicing options across product types are still siloed and that can cause additional frustration. As a personal\nexample, when I tried to open a savings account through the bank where I already have a credit card, the customer service department could not pull up my existing information because their systems were not integrated. This made me feel undervalued\nas their customer and irritated about unnecessarily having to provide basic information. Customized CX solutions, built on a solid foundation of big data analytics and AI/ML, along with system integration, can help create tailored product recommendations,\nsavings plans, and other banking services to move brands beyond impersonal or generalized interactions. As Boston Consulting Group shared:\n\u201cUltimately, if done well, personalization at scale can provide a direct route to lower rates of customer churn and higher sales. Conservatively speaking, it can lead to annual revenue uplifts of 10% for banks.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Give Them Options\u00a0In a banking research report released by Genesys and FT Longitude,\nfinancial institutions recognized as customer experience leaders are twice as likely to be available on the channel customers want when they want it (49% versus 25%). But while automation technology can often deliver more rapid responses, the need\nto keep customer information confidential has made fully embracing automation technology challenging for BFSI companies. Telephone support still outpaces digital channel adoption; and when customers have to use multiple channels to complete transactions,\nit can lead to even more frustration and a lower quality experience. There are times that the customer will want face-to-face interaction with their bank to talk through a significant investment and/or a challenging situation. The customer will want\nto be heard, discuss their options, and ask questions live with the expectation that a professional bank employee will guide them through the process. That\u2019s why balance and optionality are key.\u00a0Self-service options can inadvertently add complexity to what customers expect to be a simple process. Omnichannel solutions, enhanced self-service options, improved functionality across digital channels, and 24/7 live support can help reduce the friction,\nstreamline disparate outcomes, and make digital options easier for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partnerships You Can Bank On\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As pointed out in McKinsey & Company\u2019s 2022 article: \u201cfor\nmany [banks], a key struggle is that customer information is housed in different ways across the business and stove piped within functions, preventing the bank from gaining a complete view of the customer,\u201d but by partnering with a CX expert\nwho knows how to deliver the right blend of people, processes, and technology, customers can get the personal experiences they want from the BFSI brands they do business with. Whether it\u2019s adding automation technology with a human touch that\ncan support multiple product types or creating seamless omnichannel experiences, an experienced partner with scale, security, compliance, and digital solutions built in, can ensure optimal digital CX at every interaction. \u00a0\u00a0Because ultimately, when customers feel like they are understood, and they can trust us\u2014especially with their finances\u2014 their financial institution\u2019s wallet share grows. A strategic CX partner who knows how to deliver people-first, flexible\nand secure solutions at scale across industries makes all the difference in earning LTV.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) recently launched its long-awaited Social Responsibility in Outsourcing (SRO) Chapter with its inaugural webinar, \u201cThe Evolution of Socially Responsible Outsourcing: Relevant Now More Than Ever.\u201d Participating in the webinar, included Alorica\u2019s Chief Culture Officer Joyce Lee, along with representatives from other leading organizations including Facebook, Microsoft, Sprint and BSR.\nFor the webinar, Alorica represented service providers in the BPO industry, offering our take on the benefit and impact of a CSR program. Besides the obvious reasons that it\u2019s the right thing to do and our clients care about it, Alorica believes being socially responsible is \u201cjust good business.\u201d Being in the people-to-people business, our employees are truly our greatest assets, thus we pay attention to what attracts them, motivates them and keeps them. The result? We\u2019ve created a culture of giving back, connection and empowerment through our CSR programs.\nSo how do we do that? One way is through our partnership with Making Lives Better with Alorica (MLBA), a global non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of people in need around the world. Alorica employees lead the nearly 100 chapters worldwide, where they are empowered to support individuals, local organizations and communities that matter most to them. In less than four years, MLBA chapters have raised and distributed millions of dollars in grants and disaster relief, and our clients are noticing these efforts! One example is through our partnership with Intuit where we were selected to help with their latest impact sourcing project, establishing a Prosperity Hub in Bluefield, W. Va. This initiative will bring hundreds of jobs, providing locals with career opportunities and support through MLBA, with the end goal of helping the people there to help themselves and their own community.\nInterested in learning more about why CSR is important to Alorica?

The client sought to increase adoption of the loyalty program, and to improve the win-back of members\nwho hadn\u2019t used the loyalty program for more than six months. Enter Alorica. Cue the music.\nTHE PROGRAM\nPhase 1 of the solution involved utilizing Alorica\u2019s data scientists from the Alorica Center of Analytical Excellence (CAE) to build an effective sales coverage plan and digital sales strategy. A resulting welcome program (Scoring\nModel), comprised of targeted acquisitions and customer prospect/profiling, was thusly launched.\nPhase 2 implemented said Scoring Model (built by those alluring data scientists of ours) to win-back current loyalty program members.\nPhase 3 saw Alorica providing full account management of the client\u2019s loyalty program accounts with a focus on maintaining and increasing the client\u2019s profitability.

Since college, she\u2019s navigated her way through different positions in various\nindustries, gaining valuable experience and meeting supportive contacts along the way. Now, as Alorica\u2019s Director of Sales Enablement, she and her remote team of six help Alorica grow by assembling strategic business proposals and developing compelling sales presentations. Read her full Q&A below.\nHow did you reach your career goal of becoming a director? After I originally applied for the director position, I was disheartened when an external person was hired instead. But I knew that I was still a vital\npart of the team, so I continued to remain positive and do my best as a proposal manager. Later when that director didn\u2019t work out, I was promoted when my skills and experience demonstrated that I\u2019d be a great fit. My \u201cstick-to-it-ness\u201d\npaid off!\nWhat do you find most rewarding in your role? Seeing my team\u2019s accomplishments through organized collaboration is so rewarding because we\u2019re always working with several different people. Being in this\ncentral position exposes us to all departments and many perspectives throughout the company, making it clear that it really does take a village to prepare each well-rounded proposal and presentation.Did you have any noteworthy mentors along the way who were impactful in some way?

Before Genet and Lori met each other, they were living a parallel course. Both joined El Paso East as agents and they were equally determined to move up the ranks. As they progressed through their leadership journey, little\ndid they know\ntheir Alorica paths were about to come together \u2026\nLori\u2019s side of the story.\u201cWhen I was hired in 2014, I set a goal to become an Operations Manager in five years. I was so excited that in just a matter of months, I was offered a Team Manager position!\u201d Lori explained. She\nwas moving on up. \u00a0 And \u2026 her upcoming vacation was going to be even better knowing she was returning to her new role! She couldn\u2019t wait to get back to work and was eager to meet her new boss. Of course, she was a little nervous because, after all, first impressions\nare everything! \u00a0 When Lori returned to work, she was reassured that her new team had performed well in her absence \u2026 because her new boss was asked to skip her vacation to make sure of it. (Uh-oh!)And now, Genet\u2019s side of the story. It was 2014 and Genet was elated to be offered a promotion from Team Manager to Shift Manager. Her leadership dreams were coming true! Not only was she killing it at work, she also had a vacation\nplanned soon. \u00a0 Things were definitely going her way. \u00a0 Or so she thought. Genet was informed that the person who was replacing her as Team Manager, Ms. Lori Melendez, had already requested personal time off. Therefore, Genet, as Lori\u2019s new boss, needed to skip her own vacation! \u00a0Needless to say, Genet wasn\u2019t thrilled about this change of events. \u201cWho IS this Lori person? She\u2019s taking my team AND my vacation?!\u201d Genet exclaimed.\nUnexpected friendships are the best ones. \u201cGenet had to skip her vacation so I could take MINE!\u201d Lori was horrified. This is not the way she wanted to start things off with her new boss! \u00a0 Eventually, they were able to laugh about it. And they soon realized that together they were even better than they were individually. \u00a0 That\u2019s why, a few months later, when Genet received another promotion as Operations Manager for El Paso\u2019s Outbound Team, she immediately invited Lori to be her Team Manager. \u00a0 Not only did Genet and Lori successfully lead their team \u2026 they were ranked the #1 Outbound Team in Alorica. Because of their passion, performance and belief in limitless possibilities, they were eventually asked to oversee\nthe Inbound Team too. What a major undertaking! \u00a0 Now, four years later, Genet and Lori are inseparable. Genet is leading the Inbound Team as Operations Manager. Lori achieved her goal as the Operations Manager of Outbound. And both departments are #1. \u00a0 Way to go, Lori and Genet!

It\u2019s leaders who play the most pivotal role in driving an organization\u2019s success because a good leader can be a key reason why an employee joins, stays at or leaves a company. Below are a few strategies that I have found to be vital in establishing a work environment where employees thrive:\u00a01. Cultivate a culture of accountability:Recognizing that mistakes are an inevitable part of the development process fosters a learning-oriented environment rather than one solely focused on results. Encouraging employees to acknowledge their errors and learn from them not only enables them to feel like they can try new or hard things, but also helps boost employee satisfaction and confidence. #BeBold\u00a02. Lead by example:By taking the time to walk your employees through your thought process and actions for a project or challenge, they\u2019re able to quickly learn what to do. Especially if it\u2019s their first time, they can benefit from your experience and expertise. It also connects you more to your team, which leads to trust, engagement and high performance. #BeConnected\u00a03. Instill a forward-focused vision:Don\u2019t just give employees tasks or projects to complete. Constantly reinforce what the company\u2019s goals are and how their work makes a difference. Empower employees to make decisions in their day-to-day work by helping them think about the company\u2019s\u2014and their own\u2014long-term success. Create a vision, articulate it regularly and share updates on the progress to achieving it. This will allow them to stay committed and focused on accomplishing sustainable growth. #BeRelentless\u00a0As a leader, it\u2019s our responsibility to support our people to reach their full potential. That\u2019s what most positively impacts the overall success of an organization. And most of all, have integrity in every action. #BeTrue\u00a0What are some leadership strategies that work for you?

{"_id": "doc447", "title": "Going Beyond Your Comfort Zone", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/going-beyond-your-comfort-zone\nGoing Beyond Your Comfort Zone\nShare this\nA favorite quote can speak volumes about a person\u2019s mindset. Rita Saavedra Ortiz, Alorica\u2019s Site Director in Kingston, Jamaica, says that she references this Ralph Waldo Emerson quote often: \u201cDo not go where the path may lead, go instead\nwhere there is no path and leave a trail.\u201d \u00a0 Rita\u2019s personal story certainly fulfills that mantra. She started out as an agent in 2004, moved into quality nine months later, and then switched to operations in 2011. Just a handful of months ago, in January 2018, she moved from Panama to Jamaica\nto take on her newest challenge at the Kingston site. By seizing opportunities as they come, Rita continues to grow and learn in her career, and she inspires others around her to do the same.\nRead her full Q&A below:\nQ: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth?A: When I started working in operations seven years ago, I learned the biggest lessons in my career. One of my\nmentors said, if you fail, just learn from your mistakes and move forward. He said to step out of your comfort zone. So, I started out with a small account, and then I moved to a bigger account. I liked it\u2014the exposure with the client, getting\ninto calls with client solutions, making decisions about what is good for the business, and getting to know the financial side. When I had the opportunity to work at this big, new site in Jamaica, I knew I could do it even though it would be new for\nme.\nQ: What motivates you every day?A: I have what I call four baselines that I use every day. The first one is to be myself. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the better you can overcome\nthe roadblocks to succeed. The second one is always be positive. Ninety percent of your day is about how you look at things. The third one is never be afraid to fail. We acquire knowledge from our mistakes, whether good or bad. The fourth one is to\nget to know your people\u2014not only at the professional level, but at the personal level. Talking to people builds loyalty, and that\u2019s how you get people to not work for you, but to work with you.\nQ: If you could change anything in your career trajectory up until now, what would it be and why?A: Sometimes I think, what if I did that different? Those what ifs are part of fear. Every\ndecision I\u2019ve made, good or not so good, they got me where I am right now. I am satisfied with everything I have accomplished. I wouldn\u2019t change anything. When I transitioned from quality to training, I didn\u2019t want to leave, but\nit was a good decision. From there, I got to try new things. There\u2019s so many branches in this business. You\u2019d be surprised about what you might succeed in.\nQ: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female?A: I have never felt that being a woman in this business has been a roadblock. I\u2019ve seen many women\nin this business doing really great things and having opportunities. I always stand up for being a woman in a man\u2019s world. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross in Panama, and I was the first woman to take leadership of a group of rescuers. I\nwas able to stand up and lead that task.\nQ: Do you think it is important to be a mentor?A: Right now, my team is spread all over Panama, and I am still mentoring them. When I see my people growing, being insanely great even when\nwe aren\u2019t together, I feel proud of myself. I am a firm believer in the next line of succession plan. You have to have someone else who can take care of your programs, like a mini me.

{"_id": "doc449", "title": "Seizing the Automation Opportunity: Alorica\u2019s Automated Discovery Process", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/seizing-the-automation-opportunity-alorica-s-automated-discovery-process\nSeizing the Automation Opportunity: Alorica\u2019s Automated Discovery Process\nShare this\nOne of the first stumbling blocks of business process transformation is identifying meaningful automation opportunities. A typical process will have a management consultant, system expert, or Lean Six Sigma specialist to monitor manual processes for a\nset time, collect performance data, and make recommendations. Companies supplement this assessment with executive ideation sessions, operational managers\u2019 workshops, and superuser interviews. The traditional way to speed up and improve the accuracy\nof this approach is to add more consultants over a longer period of time analyzing larger data sets. Yet, despite these efforts, not every process is observed and not all automation opportunities are identified and prioritized.\nIn this blog, I look at how Alorica employs its proprietary tools and algorithms to streamline \u2018the discovery stage\u2019 and recommend effective automation deployment in the front-office.\nFrom manual to automated discovery\nAlorica has developed an automation approach for the discovery stage, calling it \u2018One-Click Automation\u2019. Its unsupervised machine learning algorithms measure agents\u2019 desktop utilization on a select group of 10-20 users. The bot monitors\nthe users\u2019 screen toggle, clicks, data entries and entry type, and tracks time per system and per screen, the time duration for performing each step, and the number of used fields. It counts errors, frequency, variance in the time and data entry\nquality, the end-to-end handling time, the complexity, and importance of the tasks. It also tracks the underlying communication between systems and exchanged information.\nThe bot does not capture personal data or other input information, remaining non-invasive to the systems. It also does not intervene with the users\u2019 actions. Once the bot collects enough information (~100k data points per LOB, typically in two weeks),\nit creates a visual map of the observed processes. The process map visualizes the screens, the start and end points, the navigation between them, and the direction with drill-down functionality. For large product portfolios with multiple support processes\n(for example, in technical support), Alorica requires a bigger user pool to observe.\nAlorica created the discovery bot in its Digital CoE and Innovation Lab (DCOE) in Bengaluru, launched in 2018. The automation specialists in the DCOE analyze the discovery bot results, estimate savings opportunities, and recommend and prioritize bot implementations\nwith workflow business process, exceptions adjudicator, and look-up. Because the collected information shows the actual steps and the specific systems and fields to move the data, the created automation workflows make the bot training quicker and\nmore precise. It also provides cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculation for each automation.\nImplementations for a healthcare client\nFor a U.S. healthcare payer client, Alorica deployed the discovery bots on a statistically relevant number of agent desktops for three days, identifying 150 automation opportunities in multiple processes with tasks such as secondary claims research, multifactor\ncase, clinical guidelines, and Citrix login. The algorithm analyzed the events to measure the number of agents who performed the particular process, its recurrence, and time taken. The team compared the results to the agent training guidelines, then\nAlorica prioritized with the client 11 automation initiatives that delivered the highest time and productivity savings and ROI and CX improvement.\nAlorica ran the discovery bots on both for the client\u2019s voice and non-voice work. For example, in the client\u2019s back-office, the discovery bots analyzes processes for manual data entry from image and PDF claims received over emails and e-fax.\nUsing third-party RPA & AI partner tools, Alorica created bots to capture and auto-populate fields regardless of the screen or source format while blocking certain data or document areas to meet client or compliance requirements such as HIPAA.\nIt also has exception notifications to inform live agents to validate. Another benefit is that these bots runs 24/7. The automation deployed in early 2019 delivered ~70% headcount reduction of the process headcount who translated the data from the\nclaims to the systems.\nThe company is now targeting other existing healthcare clients and showcasing their India DCOE as a \u2018digital workbench\u2019 for back-office processes, leading with automation. For automation opportunities in voice processes, Alorica is working\nwith several travel, retail, BFSI, media and telecom brands.\nAutomation in the process trenches\nThe fundamental challenge of which tasks to automate has many dimensions such as high volume, time-consuming processes, sizable FTE involvement, high error rate, or simply, risk aversion by internal IT teams. To address the latter issue, Alorica automation\ndeployments so far are on its own desktops without compromising, changing or modifying core client systems. The company absorbs the investment cost for running the discovery bots to set up a meaningful discussion with the client\u2019s process owners\non the possible cost-benefit and ROI.\nA less discussed problem with RPA projects is the impermanent state of business processes with dynamic changes of internal rules, product/services, and system environments. The shelf-life of a bot will be quite short and its ROI smaller without human\nsupervisors who in turn need to be prioritized and allocated based on business decisions. The automated desktop analytics model allows the deep learning algorithms to solve at least the first part of the challenge of identifying process impact. To\nmitigate automation program redesigns, Alorica\u2019s solution is to focus on mature system infrastructure with a steady release roadmap.\nAnother challenge to automation is the incentives for the provider. Through the achieved cost optimization and improved performance, Alorica targets a bigger share of the client wallet, looking to take over higher value processes, and switching to performance-based\npricing models. For the above-mentioned healthcare client, Alorica structured the pricing by processed claim, decreasing the overall cost by ~50%.\nThe value of partnering for automation\nWhile broad statements for full automation attract media attention, the reality for most companies is on learning. Automation is not likely to change a process but improve it and increase customer satisfaction. Partnering with an outsourcing provider\ncan deliver faster and better discovery in an ideal scenario, where the vendor has the process and domain expertise and quantitative discovery tools. The next step is to expand automation across both captive and supplier network centers to maximize\nthe benefits.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Asking Questions and Showing Results", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/the-keys-to-career-development-asking-questions-and-showing-results\nThe Keys to Career Development? Asking Questions and Showing Results\nShare this\nWhen faced with a career opportunity, is your inclination to go for it or to question your qualifications? Having the confidence to put yourself out there, whether you have the exact matching skill set or not, is one of the best learning opportunities\nthere is according to Sharon Leal, Alorica\u2019s Director, Operations based in San Antonio, Texas. \u00a0 Sharon did just that 18 years ago when she took a \u201cleap of faith\u201d and joined the BPO industry--and she hasn\u2019t looked back since. She\u2019s a huge believer in speaking up, asking questions, and helping others achieve career growth.\nRead her full Q&A below:\nQ: How have mentors helped you in your career?A: I\u2019ve always had great mentors. Early in my career, a mentor told me, \u201cdon\u2019t expect what you don\u2019t inspect.\u201d Don\u2019t\nassume everyone will do what they say and to the level you want. Another mentor gave me the advice: \u201clisten to understand.\u201d We sit and we listen, but do we really understand? Ask clarifying questions if you need to so you can lead and\nbe successful.\nQ: Can you share an example of how asking questions helped you to succeed?A: When I got the call back on my application for this company, I asked to speak to someone who was currently in this\nposition, and I spoke to that person for an hour and a half. And when they called me back and offered me the site director position, I asked what training they were going to give me. They sent me to Omaha for 6 weeks. I went through agent training,\nI took calls, I sat with the QA team, I sat with network control and workforce management. I wanted to be set up for success, to have credibility, and relate to the team I was going to manage. You can\u2019t be afraid to ask, and asking isn\u2019t\na weakness.\nQ: Do you think there is still a glass ceiling? Why or why not?A: I was told at my previous job when I got to a director level that I was only promoted because they needed to hire a woman.\nI told them I don\u2019t agree, I have worked really hard, I earned this position, and it wasn\u2019t just given to me. I don\u2019t see this at Alorica. Females can underestimate themselves, and sometimes aren\u2019t confident enough to say,\n\u201cI want to move to the next level.\u201d I\u2019ve never been shy about that. Show your confidence, shake a hand, stand up, and show that you know your business.\nQ: What aspects of the company stand out to you as an employee?A: My goal is to continue to learn everything Alorica has available to us. I\u2019m on the board of directors of MLBA, and I\nlove that we can help employees. I love everything Alorica is doing with social media\u2014that continues to promote our company and shows that they care about their employees. Culture is very important. There are 25 other call centers in San Antonio,\nbut people choose to work for us because we have an environment that people enjoy. \u00a0Q: How do you inspire others to grow in their careers?A: When I am mentoring or working with someone, I find out where they want to go and what they need to do that. You\u2019ve got to have\ngoals, work hard, and not wait on opportunities, even if you\u2019re not an exact match. I\u2019ll do a mock interview with you, and I\u2019ll look at your credentials. Sometimes people want a bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014but, well, I don\u2019t\nhave one! But if you have experience and show your results, you may be the most qualified candidate. Don\u2019t be afraid to apply, and learn from the experience.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc458", "title": "4 Ways to Turn Your Customer\u2019s Experience Into Continuous Improvement", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/4-ways-to-turn-your-customers-experience-into-continuous-improvement\n4 Ways to Turn Your Customer\u2019s Experience Into Continuous Improvement\nShare this\nThe moment when a customer reaches out for support after acquiring a new product or service, is a golden opportunity to drive customer satisfaction AND gather insight at the same time. Four key steps and a little planning can turn this initial customer\nsupport call into continuous improvement and a gift for future innovation.\n1. Know Your Customer\nSegmentation is powerful.\u00a0 When your customers ask for assistance, it\u2019s important to collect the right information so that the customer is assigned to the right segment. Demographic information goes without saying, but focus should also be\ngiven to the\u00a0type\u00a0of customer a person is.\nHow long have they been a customer?How many of your products do they own?How often are they reaching out for support?What past issues have they needed assistance with?Having this insight helps in the way you communicate with the customer later, while also helping you understand how to position self-service and working to find the right solution.\n2. Identify the Problem \u00a0 It may seem simple, but often, companies are not collecting information around\u00a0why the customer is reaching out for help. Knowing the issue\u00a0type\u00a0is critical. Understanding the top customer issues will help you create better\nself-service content, while also providing meaningful information on where product development should focus on driving improvements. In the Forrester article, \u201cInsights-Driven Business Set the Pace for Global Growth\u201d, Forrester\nreferences that insight-driven businesses grow on average 30% more annually than businesses with close-looped learning processes.\u201d1 \u00a0 In an era where information changes so rapidly, the more we leverage what we are learning to make the process better for the customer, the greater opportunity we must drive a better satisfaction level.\n3. Balance Customer Resolution with Customer Effort \u00a0 Resolution is the most critical component as to whether a customer is happy with their support experience. However, it is also necessary to understand the effort the customer had to take to resolve the issue. The more effort required, the more the experience\ndeteriorates. In the recent Alorica eBook,\u00a0Deflecting Call Volume;\u00a0resolution is identified as the largest\ninfluencer of positive customer experience scores. Repeat attempts to resolve issues are not only detrimental to experience scores, but also, they are expensive to support. Therefore, understanding what drives and prevents resolution is a critical\ncomponent of your contact reduction strategy.2 \u00a0 When we think of resolution, we think of it two ways.\nFirst Contact Resolution:\u00a0It\u2019s crucial you understand from the customer whether their issue was resolved the first time. Gathering this information will provide you a tracking mechanism for how well your self-service or\nknowledgebase articles are solving your customer\u2019s issue. This data allows you to pinpoint your opportunities to drive improvement in your self-service content, potentially reducing support calls and driving improvement in customer support.Issue Resolution:\u00a0Issue resolution is a measurement of whether the customer\u2019s issue was resolved. It\u2019s important to understand from the customer what prevented resolution from happening more quickly. This is where\nyou typically gain insight from the customer about being transferred, escalation to a higher level of support, etc. While the customer may now appreciate the fact that their issue is resolved, you will likely see an impact to their overall experience\ngiven the delay in resolution. Remember, resolution and speed of resolution is where you begin to gain customer loyalty.\n4. Build Brand Loyalty \u00a0 One of the best indicators of a customer\u2019s satisfaction level with their support experience is whether they will recommend your brand to others. Collecting this information from the customer after you solve their problem will allow you to better\nunderstand how your support model is impacting or driving the overall customer experience. \u00a0Information is key but listening to your customers and then building a process that allows you to continuously learn will set you apart from others in your industry.\u00a0 In a recent blog by COPC, \u201cThe Value of Listening: How feedback can be an\nopportunity to bring brand image to life,\u201d the author mentions that customers are paying more attention to how a brand responds than ever before.3\u00a0As you better understand your customer segment, how often they call,\nthe types of issues that occur for them, what upsets them and the speed with which\u00a0you can help them, you are armed with information that allows you to drive improvement in the way you service similar customers. When you listen to your customers\nand begin to reduce the effort by the customer and resolve their issues in a timely manner, you reduce the frustration level of the customer and begin to drive brand loyalty and a greater experience for your customers. \u00a0 Competition is everywhere. Issues are going to occur. Building a support model that simplifies the path to your customers\u2019 resolution is important. As you leverage learnings from your customers\u2019 experiences and incorporate those into your\never-changing support model, you begin to reduce the number of support calls required, the length of the call and the effort your customers must spend in getting their issues resolved gets reduced. The cost of your support model will go down and you\nwill gain appreciation and loyalty from your customers as you continue to improve the model to solve their problems. Customers know issues will arise, but the ease and speed in which you solve those issues is what will set you apart from your competition.\nSOURCES\nhttps://www.forrester.com/report/InsightsDriven+Businesses+Set+The+Pace+For+Global+Growth/-/E-RES130848\u201cDeflecting Call Volume,\u201d\u00a0Alorica, 2017,\u00a0https://www.alorica.com/insights/resource/deflecting-call-volume-5-ways-to-drive-calls-out-of-your-call-center.Jezierski, Kathleen, \u201cThe Value of Listening: How feedback can be an opportunity to bring brand image to life,\u201d COPC, May 1, 2017,\u00a0http://www.copc.com/blog/value-listening-brand-image/.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

{"_id": "doc459", "title": "6 Reasons Why Millennials Are Better Than Their Stereotype", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/6-reasons-why-millennials-are-better-than-their-stereotype\n6 Reasons Why Millennials Are Better Than Their Stereotype\nShare this\nShaming our youth is a tradition as old as dirt. In recent history Generation X was known as a group of \u201cSlackers.\u201d Before Gen X, the original \u201cME\u201d generation was the \u201cHippies\u201d, the Baby Boomers who are now so worried\nabout these \u201clazy, entitled, narcissistic\u201d Millennials.\nYou can\u2019t understand anyone accurately when you\u2019re judging them\u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what we do when we rely on stereotypes.\nGreg Johnson, Chairman and CEO,\u00a0Damar Services\u00a0said, \u201cI find that it is dangerous to overgeneralize this demographic. We have\nencountered many who are thoughtful, resourceful, open-minded and even visionary community stewards \u2026 Our challenge is to personalize the impact and engage them in ways that engender ownership and investment.\u201d1\u00a0And for\ncontact center operations hungry for a young and tech-savvy workforce, Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. labor market\u2014with 56 million now working.2\nRather than putting a whole group of individuals into a stereotype and judging them harshly, get to know them as individuals. You\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. Who knows? You may even find common ground!\nYou would think that over thousands of years we might have learned to dispel stereotypes. Sadly, we haven\u2019t. This is one \u201cway that it\u2019s always been done\u201d that it\u2019s time to let go of, and here are 6 great reasons why.\n#1. Data doesn\u2019t tell the whole story\nMillennials get a bad rap. And though plenty of people think that they lack a strong work ethic, feel deserving of special treatment and shy away from commitment of any kind, the reality is that they are not that different from the generations that came\nbefore them.3\u00a0While the data we read may be statistically accurate, much of it has nothing to do with social science. Even the content that does come from social science\u2014like the reliable statistics we read about from the Gallup\nOrganization\u2014while accurate, doesn\u2019t tell the context of the Millennial experience.\nWhy? Because these surveys don\u2019t consider the fact that Millennials are going through a new life stage called \u201cemerging adulthood\u201d. According to Haydn\nShaw, generational and cultural differences expert, recognizing that full adulthood begins at age 27 or 28 is important because, \u201cif it\u2019s the Millennials,\nthen it\u2019s a problem that needs to be fixed\u2026if it\u2019s a life stage, it\u2019s a change that we need to understand and adapt to. And understanding that makes working together easier.\u201d\n#2. Millennials work to live, not live to work\nMillennials place a higher premium on the success of their personal lives\u2014even above their careers.\u00a0According to Darlene Corbett, a therapist and success coach, \u201clike many generations before Millennials, marriage and family are part of\nthe big picture for the Millennial population.4\nBut there is more to this story. They want to spend time with their families\u00a0and\u00a0fulfill career aspirations. If companies want to tap the loyalty and the career aspirations of this generation for leadership development,\nthey should create a work environment that respects personal values, especially related to family.\nFind ways to demonstrate that you care about the success of their family life and empower them to build a great career without damaging their personal relationships.\n#3. Millennials desire personal growth\nWork-life balance is important to Millennials; they want to work for companies who prioritize the things that matter most to them\u2014such as health, family and leisure time.5\nMillennials are looking for job opportunities where they can learn and grow. They crave continuous feedback and coaching and that\u2019s a good thing! Instead of viewing it as a chore, capitalize on the opportunity to mentor them.\nGen Y is attracted to leaders who clearly articulate the WHY, the purpose behind how work gets done every day. They are looking for coaches who will champion them, encourage them, inspire and motivate them, and challenge them to greatness.\nCompanies have more and more knowledge and skill leaving the workforce and a whole bunch of young fresh workers who want to grow. Why not pair them up and be intentional about having those with expertise invest in those who need and desperately want to\ngrow? Sounds like a win-win.\n#4.\u00a0Millennials live their ideals\nAccording to Jean Case, Founder and CEO of The Case Foundation, Millennials invest in the things they care about. A 2017 Millennials Report indicates that Millennials are even more invested in philanthropy than in previous years, and put an emphasis on\nCSR in the workplace.6\nA common adage in leadership is to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. Well, Millennials are doing just that! They are setting a great example. Cheer them on, or better yet, follow suit.\nRecognize that their genuineness will build a whole new generation of leaders in the workforce that leads by example. That is sorely needed in this age where distrust of leadership can wreak havoc in organizations.\n#5. Millennials number 73 million\nMillennials are projected to overtake Boomers as America\u2019s largest generation in 2019, with 73 million individuals. In fact, as of 2017, Millennials were already the largest population in the workforce\u2014with 56 million working or looking for\nwork.\n7\n#6.\u00a0Millennials are the future (like it or not)\nAs Padraig Cotter points out \u201cMillennials are redesigning the future of work. They\u2019re digital natives and it\u2019s no longer a case of employees adjusting to their work; it\u2019s about\u00a0 the work adjusting to them. New ways of thinking\nare crucial, and Millennials can provide this.\u201d8\nOftentimes, fear holds us back \u2013 fear of the unknown, fear of change or just blind fear. But there\u2019s a whole generation of young people brimming with talent and yearning for a chance to make their mark on the world. Let\u2019s not succumb\nto fear and judgment just because we don\u2019t know or understand them.\nMillennials and contact centers are a perfect match. Get behind Millennials, invest in them, and support them as they take you to places you\u2019ve never gone before!

{"_id": "doc461", "title": "Utility Industry Looks to Omnichannel Support", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/utility-industry-looks-to-omnichannel-support\nUtility Industry Looks to Omnichannel Support\nShare this\nIt all started in the 1990s. Ongoing legislative changes in the utility sector have produced a gradual shift on the pricing and delivery of electricity from strict government regulation to the impact of market forces. Natural gas and green solutions like solar and wind power have also come under review. Non-utilities now have direct retail access to residential consumers in 18 jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada, representing more than\u00a039 million residential accounts1.\u00a0Of those,\u00a044 percent receive services2\u00a0from a retail energy provider (REP), as of year-end 2014.\nAlthough the legislative environment is still very much in flux, utility companies increasingly recognize the need to restructure their approach to service delivery and customer support as with any consumer product or service, new technologies and an increasingly emboldened user base demand greater attention to the consumer relationship.\nIn this highly controlled industry, demand from utility providers, REPs and consumers to provide more immediate and flexible options for customer care has placed pressure on regulators to redefine interaction with consumers. Currently, Utilities and Energy Suppliers must adhere to strict protocols related to communication\u2014specifically these protocols dictate the frequency and channels through which issues related to service and payments can be conducted.\u00ad\u00ad As a result, many companies have moved to un-silo their Care and First Party collections teams and combine them to form a more cohesive and unified operation for three key reasons: Consistency, Focus on Customer Experience, and Improved Revenue Recovery.\nAlorica, a contact center outsourcing leader in the Energy Utility sector, has introduced Financial Care (through its subsidiary, EGS Financial Care, Inc.) to help meet the growing shift in the service mix in the industry that focuses on Care, First Party Collection and Omnichannel flexibility. These services help Utilities bridge the gap between regulators and the millennial generation, who prefer Web-based self-service options and appreciate the sense of empowerment that comes from different delivery models (such as prepaid energy).\nAs they consider how to better support the stakeholders at all levels, utility regulators and electricity providers should consider the following market trends:\nConsumers are increasingly mobile.Smartphone technology and cloud-based systems have made it possible for people to manage their utilities anywhere, anytime \u2013 everything from turning devices on and off, to re-programming their thermostat settings, to making a payment. And as technology continues to advance, consumers will look for further innovation from utility providers related to mobile platforms.\nConsumers want more control over costs.The idea of prepaid electric service \u2013 based on previous consumption rates \u2013 has already gained traction with consumers who are now seeing energy savings between 5.5 and 14 percent3.\u00a0However, this model brings with it new challenges; specifically, protecting customers who may underestimate their usage, particularly because\u00a0utility companies have more leeway in terms of shutting off service4.\nSmart meters mean more programs.\u00a0Smart meters, which measure energy usage in increments as small as every 15 minutes, have opened up opportunities for time-based rate programs. Rather than being billed based on flat or tiered rates,\u00a0consumers can benefit5\u00a0from the variability over time in the cost to produce electricity and see a cost saving through dynamic rates.\u00a0Energy companies potentially can capture a greater market share if they can explain the pricing models effectively and provide tools for customers to self-check meter readings.\nNew developments in technology, combined with the removal of barriers to entry for retail choices, means that utility providers must address changing consumer preferences, or be left behind with antiquated systems and processes. From innovative pricing models and payment plans to self-service options and mobile-friendly tools, electric companies that take an omnichannel approach to customer care and support have the opportunity to effectively differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market and foster further positive change for the industry as a whole.\nWhen you consider this dramatic industry shift and the cost and timing associated with implementing change, many utilities and energy marketers are beginning to shift responsibility and accountability to outsourced customer contact center relationships. Companies like Alorica have the depth of experience, resources and PCI-compliant technology to seamlessly extend the existing platforms and capabilities within the in-house Utility contact center while blending omnichannel solutions\u2014eliminating significant capital expense, time delay and HR challenges.\nThrough outsourcing, Utilities are introducing new services today that are strengthening customer experience and satisfaction ratings.

{"_id": "doc464", "title": "Level Up Gamer Loyalty in a Digital-First Experience Economy", "text": "https://alorica.com/insights/resource/level-up-gamer-loyalty-in-digital-first-experience-economy\nLevel Up Gamer Loyalty in a Digital-First Experience Economy\nShare this\nThere are many ingredients a video game company can draw on to generate sustainable user growth. From discounts & online events to patches and expansion packs, game developers, publishers, and the cloud platform providers leverage all sorts of campaigns\nthat entice players to stay plugged in and eager to invite friends and family to join the fun. One underappreciated element that gaming companies can tap into for community building\u2014and brand loyalty\u2014is customer support, which has taken\non greater importance in the past year due to the huge influx of new gamers.\nThe current gaming boom is not exactly unique. The industry has seen explosive\ngrowth in the past, with eight generations of consoles recruiting a whole new crop\nof hardcore and casual gamers. The difference this time around is that the latest surge coincides with the ascent of the digital-first experience economy. The modern-day gamer has grown accustomed to the conveniences provided by app-based food delivery\nordering and the chance to ask a brand a question about a product over direct messaging on social media. They assume their bank, grocer, retailer, streamer, and game provider can and should do the same. As a result, a comprehensive player support\nstrategy today must embrace the following objectives to ensure a resilient and profitable customer experience (CX) operation.\nAll-Inclusive Player Support\nThe gaming industry is not exactly a stranger to customer support. Since the advent of the internet, video game companies have had to resolve issues that revolve around account management, tech support, and everything in between. The gaming craze that\ntook shape in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated the need for quality customer service, as lengthier queues and denser contacts became the norm in many cases. The broad range of services a modern CX team is required to offer grew\nby the day. The baseline now seems to comprise the basics, such as account management & payment processing, plus community moderation, knowledge management expansion, live events support, and protecting gamers against fraud.\nThen there is the scale. The gaming community touches all corners of the globe, so video game companies must be able to support an international audience that speaks a wide set of languages across every time zone. Even better, support agents should have\nthe regional know-how to allow companies to truly localize their products in every market. With global gaming revenue exceeding $180 billion and no signs of slowing down, gaming companies need to adopt robust CX services now or risk losing players\nto the companies that do.\nBuilding Loyalty Outside the Game\nRegardless of industry, market data consistently demonstrates that positive customer experiences are a major competitive differentiator. The challenge is that customer experiences in 2021 look a lot different than they did a decade ago. For starters, consumers have dramatically changed the way they communicate\nwith one another. Millennials and Generation Z have jumpstarted this shift. These digital natives overwhelmingly prefer to communicate via digital messaging tools as opposed to traditional channels \u2013 and this appears to apply whether they are engaging their best friends or their favorite brands. Overall, the younger generations are more comfortable with digital channels, whether they are powered by humans or bots.\nIt also follows the logic that Generation Z is more open to using AI-powered chatbots because\nthey have experience with AI applications from the games they grew up with. Deploying virtual assistants makes it easier for tech-savvy consumers to engage brands while supplying contact centers the extra bandwidth to resolve any number of issues.\nThe point is to give consumers choice. Introducing omnichannel functionality through voice and text-based capabilities enables support teams to meet players through their favorite channels, creating positive impressions in the process. The number\none goal of every developer and publisher should be that players are spending their time on game play and not support issues.\nCultivating Trust and Safety\nAs gaming companies continue to develop multiple revenue streams, the risk and volume of fraud, not to mention account abuse, are sure to increase. The average player today is more likely to engage brands outside the game, whether that\u2019s consuming\nYouTube reviews, Twitch live streams, podcast recordings, message boards, and the targeted journalism devoted to gaming. The abundance of media today has seeped into the mainstream, exposing players to content that was traditionally only seen or heard\nby the most serious of fans. And with consumers having a heightened awareness of privacy and security, video game companies must protect players efficiently and responsively from fraud across all channels.\nCompanies that provide reliable, safe environments are more likely to realize player community growth.\u00a0 As consumer behavior and expectations change, so too must player support. As much as game developers, publishers, and cloud platforms prioritize\ndeveloping the coolest, most popular games, they also need to place emphasis on offering a modern, comprehensive customer journey that makes it easy for players to simply focus on playing their next game. Only then will they foster loyalty and expand\ntheir user base.\nVisit our\nGaming industry solution page to learn how Alorica can help improve your player experience both in-game and out of it with our omnichannel customer support.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

Already valued at $50B in 2019, the global telehealth market is expected to reach $460B by 2030.1It\u2019s here to stay. Telehealth services are more accessible\u2014especially in the wake of COVID-19. In the U.S., the passage of the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2022 makes it even more accessible, allowing\nMedicare recipients to access telehealth services through 2024.\u00a0\u00a0Older patients rely on it. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 43% of adults aged 65+ use telehealth services for everything from general everyday needs like diagnosing and treating common colds and flus and\nfollow-up visits to managing chronic conditions, more than any other age group. And considering that America\u2019s 65+ population is projected to nearly double over the next 30 years2 \u2014from $48M to $88M by 2050\u2014that\u2019s a whole lot of users!\u00a0It\u2019s key to market positioning. With the age of online medicine and distributed care in full swing, healthcare systems are competing with retail clinics, big tech, digital healthtech startups, and payers. And considering that 60% of consumers expect their digital healthcare experiences to mirror retail3 and feel that just one bad experience is too many4 , only companies who deliver consistently great CX are poised to come out on top.\u00a0\u00a0Specialties are continually expanding into it. Although in-patient visits are still necessary for some conditions and emergency situations, telehealth is used for everything from Alzheimer\u2019s support and diabetes management\nto pre-and-post chemotherapy patient monitoring. Healthtech has also been a virtual lifeline for patients in rural communities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Want to make telehealth easier for you\u2014and your customers?

To her, being a mentor is an integral part\nof her daily life. You know the concept of \u201cpaying it forward\u201d? Well, that describes Albertha to the T. \u00a0 Even though you could say that Albertha fell into the training and development field, it\u2019s no accident that led her to her current role as VP, Operations Training at Alorica. She\u2019s someone who truly enjoys\nteaching people and seeing them succeed. \u00a0Read her full Q&A below:Q: What was your strategy for reaching an executive level position in your career?A: My strategy has been to always keep in touch with the company\u2019s goals and initiatives.\nIf we\u2019re not aligned, we\u2019re not anything. I learned years ago that the purpose of training is to achieve a business result, and you can only achieve that when you know the goals. I\u2019ve done this throughout my career. \u00a0Q: Did you ever work with a mentor, and how did that process help you? A: I like to say that I\u2019ve had many mentors, even though they may not have known. If I see someone who has\na talent, trait or skill that I admire, I\u2019m going to get to know them. I will insert myself in their space and ask them to teach me. As you supervise people, you should be their teacher and guide. If I know something, I\u2019m going to share\nit with you and my team. There\u2019s no value in holding back information. The more we all know, the more we can be successful together. \u00a0Q: Can you think of an example when you faced pushback at work because you were female? How did you face that challenge?A: As I look at challenges that I\u2019ve had, I try to not\nlook at it from the perspective of, \u201care you challenging me because I\u2019m a female or a different race?\u201d What I do is if someone is challenging me, or doesn\u2019t want to work with me, I find out why. You\u2019re going to work with\nall different types of people with different ideologies about a lot of different things. What are you going to do? You have to work through each issue.\nQ: How has working at Alorica specifically led to your personal career growth?A: At Alorica, this Women\u2019s Initiative is very exciting. It\u2019s wonderful that the company has\ntaken this opportunity to say we need to do more, we need to help to educate and grow our female work force. In my area, I find the training field exciting. Even though I fell into this position, it was definitely a great fit for me. It fit my natural\ntendencies which is to want to see people succeed. In training, you get the satisfaction of seeing someone on the operations floor being successful. I love investing in each person.\nQ: How important is it to have a career plan? How often do you outline your personal career goals?A: I look at where I am, generally in December or January. I\u2019m a linear person,\nand I do things in a timeline. I look back at the goals I made last year. Did I meet them, how close did I get, and should I realign them? I do checks along the way to make sure I\u2019m on track throughout the year. There are times when life happens,\npersonal life or changes in the company that can bump you off course. Then, you have to look at your original goal and ask if that\u2019s the right one to have. A goal is just that\u2014it\u2019s a point of direction, but you have to be flexible\nenough to take detours.\nThank you for filling out our form.\nGet the Report\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nWork Phone\nCompany Name\nDownload\nBy creating an account to access our gated information, you agree that you may receive communications from Alorica Inc., including its affiliates and subsidiaries, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates.

At Alorica, our approach to protecting the planet as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social &\nGovernance (ESG) is no different than how we advance our philanthropic and people-centered programs\u2014we stay connected with the needs and interests of our employees and then we empower each other to make a difference where it matters\nmost. The key is to get started from wherever you can in as many different ways as possible!\u00a0As a large employer in the people business, it\u2019s important that Alorica leads initiatives to positively impact the countries in which we operate. We focus on maintaining sustainable operations across our large-scale contact centers, whether it\u2019s\nby partnering with vendors that are sustainability experts in managing and recycling waste or making environmentally conscious changes to our offices.\u00a0A few examples:Transition to LED lights and energy-efficient HVAC systems Implementation of a GREENGUARD-certified Healthy High-Performance Cleaning (HHPC) program to use green, earth-friendly cleaning productsENERGY STAR certification by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at our sites (and counting!), meaning that these buildings use less energy and cause fewer greenhouse gas emissions than their peersSignificant reduction of our carbon footprint by cutting down employees\u2019 commute and usage of environment-impacting office protocols through our work-at-home program\u2014Alorica AnywhereTracking and reporting of our ESG efforts through participation in the annual Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which enables us to achieve our sustainability goals and align closely with our clients\u2019 objectives\u00a0But there\u2019s something else businesses can do. What we\u2019ve learned at Alorica is that educating and encouraging our 115,000+ employees to also do their part makes a huge difference. Our people are passionate and they make things happen! Last\nyear, we had nearly 44,000 employees complete our annual Sustainability Survey! Out of these participants\u202681% of Aloricans shared that they commuted to work sustainably (biking, walking, carpooling)86% used energy-efficient light bulbs90% of employees consciously didn\u2019t print (paper) regularly for work \u00a0Not only that, but our employees chose eco-friendly projects as their teambuilding activities and as part of our 2022 Passion for the Planet contest, which led to 1,588 trees being planted and 188,000 pounds of material being recycled. We\ncontinue to measure and recognize these initiatives as well as share tips and key facts to remind our workforce that every environment-focused action counts.\u00a0So, let\u2019s continue to be intentional together. Whether it\u2019s using your own reusable water bottle, turning off lights and water when not in use, or being conscious of how much plastic/packaging is being used when you shop\u2014our efforts\nmatter.
